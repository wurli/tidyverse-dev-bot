# R6 2.5.1.9000

!begin-bullets-1!

-   !begin-bullet!
    R6 methods no longer recommends `initialize` or `.__enclos_env__` in
    autocomplete.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The deprecated `lock` parameter has been removed.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `R6Class()` now prints a message when a `finalize` method is public
    instead of private.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    When a superclass is not cloneable, then subclasses cannot be
    cloneable (@IndrajeetPatil, #247).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #253: Errors could occur when deep cloning if a member object
    was an environment with a class that had a `$` method. Deep cloning
    now uses `get0()` instead of `$`. R6 now requires R \>= 3.2.

# R6 2.5.0

!begin-bullets-3!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Resolved #195: Slightly clearer message when there is an error in
    the `initialize()` method.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #214: When a non-portable object inheritance was cloned,
    methods that were inherited (and not overridden) had the wrong
    environment. (#215, #217)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Printing R6 objects, no longer includes `.__active__`.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-3!

# R6 2.4.1

!begin-bullets-4!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Cloning active bindings previously relied on buggy behavior in
    `as.list.environment()`, which would return the active binding's
    function definition rather than the value from invoking the
    function. In R 4.0, the behavior will chang so that it returns the
    value. R6 now no longer relies on this buggy behavior. (#192)
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-4!

# R6 2.4.0

!begin-bullets-5!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #146: Finalizers can now be private methods. (#181)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #167: Finalizers now run on cloned objects. (#180)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-5!

# R6 2.3.0

!begin-bullets-6!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Vignettes are no longer included as part of the source package
    because of their large size. Documentation is now at
    https://r6.r-lib.org/.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #125: The `print.R6` method now always returns the object that
    was passed to it.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #155: In some cases, a cloned object's methods could refer to
    the wrong `super` object. (#156)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #94, #133: When cloning an object which contained a function
    that is *not* a method, the corresponding function in the new object
    would have its environment changed, as though it were a method. Now
    it no longer has a changed environment. (#156)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #121: If a `finalize` method was present, it would prevent
    objects passed to `initialize` from getting GC'd.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #158: If a `$set` method of an R6 generator object is given
    the value `NULL`, it previously removed the named item. Now it adds
    the named item with the value `NULL`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #159: Printing an R6 object containing a large vector was
    slow.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-6!

# R6 2.2.2

!begin-bullets-7!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #108: When an object with a `super` object and an active
    binding in the `super` object was cloned, the new object's `super`
    object did not get the active binding -- it was a normal function.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #119: When a class had two levels of inheritance, an instance
    of that class's `super` object could contain methods that had an
    incorrect enclosing environment.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-7!

# R6 2.2.1

!begin-bullets-8!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Vignettes now only try use the microbenchmark package if it is
    present. This is so that the package builds properly on platforms
    where microbenchmark is not present, like Solaris.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed ending position for `trim()`.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-8!

# R6 2.2.0

!begin-bullets-9!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Classes can define finalizers explicitly, by defining a public
    `finalize` method. (#92, #93)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Added function `is.R6()` and `is.R6Class()`. (#95)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed #96: R6 now avoids using `$` and `[[` after the class has been
    assigned to the object. This allows the user to provide their own
    methods for `$` and `[[` without causing problems to R6's operation.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-9!

# R6 2.1.3

!begin-bullets-10!

-   !begin-bullet!
    The `plot` S3 method for R6 objects will call `$plot` on the object
    if present. (#77)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed printing of members that are R6 objects. (#88)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed deep cloning for non-portable classes. (#85)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Added `as.list.R6` method. (#91)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-10!

# R6 2.1.2

!begin-bullets-11!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Implemented `format.R6()` and `format.R6ClassGenerator`, the former
    calls a public `format` method if defined. This might change the
    functionality of existing classes that define a public `format`
    method intended for other purposes (#73. Thanks to Kirill Müller)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Functions are shown with their interface in `print` and `format`,
    limited to one line (#76. Thanks to Kirill Müller)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    R6 objects and generators print out which class they inherit from.
    (#67)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-11!

# R6 2.1.1

!begin-bullets-12!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed a bug with printing R6 objects when a `[[` method is defined
    for the class. (#70)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed cloning of objects that call a `super` method which accesses
    `private`. (#72)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-12!

# R6 2.1.0

!begin-bullets-13!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Added support for making clones of R6 objects with a `clone()`
    method on R6 objects. The `deep=TRUE` option allows for making
    clones that have copies of fields with reference semantics (like
    other R6 objects). (#27)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Allow adding public or private members when there were no public or
    private members to begin with. (#51)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Previously, when an R6 object was printed, it accessed (and called)
    active bindings. Now it simply reports that a field is an active
    binding. (#37, #38. Thanks to Oscar de Lama)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Printing private members now works correctly for portable R6
    objects. (#26)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The 'lock' argument has been renamed to 'lock_objects'. Also, there
    is a new argument, 'lock_class', which can prevent changes to the
    class. (#52)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed printing of NULL fields.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-13!

# R6 2.0.1

!begin-bullets-14!

-   !begin-bullet!
    A superclass is validated on object instantiation, not on class
    creation.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Added `debug` and `undebug` methods to generator object.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-14!

# R6 2.0

!begin-bullets-15!

-   !begin-bullet!
    \[BREAKING CHANGE\] Added `portable` option, which allows
    inheritance across different package namespaces, and made it the
    default.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Added `set()` method on class generator object, so new fields and
    methods can be added after the generator has been created.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    All of the functions involved in instantiating objects are
    encapsulated in an environment separate from the R6 namespace. This
    means that if a generator is created with one version of R6, saved,
    then restored in a new R session that has a different version of R6,
    there shouldn't be any problems with compatibility.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Methods are locked so that they can't be changed. (Fixes #19)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Inheritance of superclasses is dynamic; instead of reading in the
    superclass when a class is created, this happens each time an object
    is instantiated. (Fixes #12)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Added trailing newline when printing R6 objects. (Thanks to Gabor
    Csardi)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The `print` method of R6 objects can be redefined. (Thanks to Gabor
    Csardi)
