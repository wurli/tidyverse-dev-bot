# tidyverse (development version)

!begin-bullets-1!

-   Add lubridate to the core tidyverse (#157).

!end-bullets-1!

# tidyverse 1.3.2

!begin-bullets-2!

-   Text version of the citation now lists all authors (#269).

-   All packages have been bumped to their latest versions.

-   Messaging uses modern approach to avoid red text in RStudio (#296).

!end-bullets-2!

# tidyverse 1.3.1

!begin-bullets-3!

-   tidyverse now installs dtplyr (#216), googledrive, and googlesheets4
    (#229). All packages have been bumped to their latest versions.

-   License changed to MIT (#235).

!end-bullets-3!

# tidyverse 1.3.0

!begin-bullets-4!

-   The tidyverse now has an associated paper at the [Journal of Open
    Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) that you can use to cite
    the tidyverse if you use it in a paper - see `citation("tidyverse")`
    for details.

-   Eliminate repeats in the package list when loading an odd number of
    packages (#94, #100, @dchiu911)

-   Packages attached from same library they were initially loaded from
    (#171, @gabrocsardi)

-   If conflicted package is loaded, omit display of conflicts. This
    includes fix to `tidyverse_conflicts()` to avoid accidentally
    triggering conflicted shims (#136).

-   `tidyverse_deps()` now succeeds even if a dependency of a dependency
    is missing (#152, @PoGibas). It no longer includes dependencies that
    are needed by the tidyverse package but are not strictly part of the
    tidyverse (i.e.Â cli, crayon, and rstudioapi).

-   `tidyverse_deps()` and `tidyverse_update()` gain a new `repos`
    argument that gets passed to the base function
    `available.packages()` (@zkamvar, #82)

-   `tidyverse_packages()` correctly returns packages names (#93, #106,
    @coatless)

-   `tidyverse_sitrep()` gives you a situation report on your install of
    the tidyverse (#203)

!end-bullets-4!

# tidyverse 1.2.1

!begin-bullets-5!

-   Require modern versions of all packages (#85)

-   Work with RStudio 1.0 and earlier (#88).

!end-bullets-5!

# tidyverse 1.2.0

## Changes to tidyverse membership

!begin-bullets-6!

-   stringr and forcats have been added to the core tidyverse, so they
    are attached by `library(tidyverse)`.

-   reprex joins the tidyverse to make it easier to create reproducible
    examples (#47)

!end-bullets-6!

## Other improvements

!begin-bullets-7!

-   On attach, tidyverse now makes better use of the horizontal space,
    printing packages and versions in two columns (#59). It only prints
    packages that it attaches, not packages that you've already
    attached. Development versions are highlighted in red.

    You can now suppress this startup message by setting
    `options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)`

-   `tidyverse_conflicts()` now prints all conflicts that involve at
    least one tidyverse package; Previously it only omitted any
    intra-tidyverse conflicts (#26). I've also tweaked the display of
    conflicts to hopefully make it more clear which function is the
    "winner".

-   `tidyverse_update()` now just gives you the code you need to update
    the packges, since in general it's not possible to update packages
    that are already loaded.

-   feather is now *actually* in suggests.

!end-bullets-7!

# tidyverse 1.1.1

!begin-bullets-8!

-   Moved feather from Imports to Suggests - feather is part of the
    tidyverse but it's installation requirements (C++11 + little-endian)
    make it painful in many scenarios (#36).

!end-bullets-8!

# tidyverse 1.1.0

!begin-bullets-9!

-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

-   Membership changes:

    !begin-bullets-10!
    -   Removed DBI (since very different API, #16)
    -   Added feather (#15)

    !end-bullets-10!

-   `tidyverse_deps()` and `tidyverse_packages()` are now exported so
    you can more easily see the make up of the tidyverse, and what
    package versions you have (#18, #23)

-   `suppressPackageStartupMessages()` now suppresses all messages
    during loading (#19). `suppressPackageStartupMessages()` is called
    automatically for all tidyverse packages (#27).

!end-bullets-9!
