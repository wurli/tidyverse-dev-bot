# tibble 3.1.8.9001

## Chore

!begin-bullets-1!

-   Require vctrs \>= 0.4.1 and pillar \>= 1.8.1

-   Skip tests if suggested packages not available (#1246,
    @MichaelChirico).

!end-bullets-1!

# tibble 3.1.8.9000

!begin-bullets-2!

-   Internal changes only.

!end-bullets-2!

# tibble 3.1.8

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-3!

-   Better reporting for error calls from `vec_as_location()` (#1237).

-   Mention `median()` in Recovery section of `vignette("numbers")`
    (#1197).

!end-bullets-3!

# tibble 3.1.7

## Breaking change

!begin-bullets-4!

-   `trunc_mat()` now returns a value with a different structure. This
    is considered an implementation detail that can change in the
    future, do not rely on it. The only guarantee is that calling
    `print()` will display the input like a tibble (#1059).

!end-bullets-4!

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-5!

-   Avoid listing `dim_desc()` in reexports.
-   Add more examples for data frame and matrix columns (#978, #1012).

!end-bullets-5!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-6!

-   Require rlang 1.0.1 and pillar 1.7.0 (#1063).
-   Prefer `class` over `.subclass` in `rlang::error_cnd()` (#1015,
    #1060).

!end-bullets-6!

# tibble 3.1.6

!begin-bullets-7!

-   `set_num_opts()` and `set_char_opts()` are reexported from pillar
    (#959).
-   `view()` uses `rlang::expr_deparse(width = Inf)` to avoid errors
    with long `|>` pipes (#957).
-   `new_tibble()` checks that the `nrow` argument is nonnegative and
    less than 2\^31 (#916).
-   `tbl_sum.tbl_df()` has an ellipsis in its formals for extensibility.

!end-bullets-7!

# tibble 3.1.5

!begin-bullets-8!

-   Avoid necessity to set `"tibble.view_max"` option for lazy tables
    (#954).
-   Avoid blanket import for lifecycle package for compatibility with
    upcoming rlang (#955, @romainfrancois).

!end-bullets-8!

# tibble 3.1.4

## Features

!begin-bullets-9!

-   `as.data.frame.tbl_df()` strips inner column names (#837).
-   `new_tibble()` allows omitting the `nrow` argument again (#781).

!end-bullets-9!

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-10!

-   Move `vignette("digits")`, `vignette("numbers")`, `?num` and `?char`
    from the pillar package here (#913).
-   Replace `iris` by `trees` (#943).
-   Various documentation improvements.
-   New `?tibble_options` help page (#912).

!end-bullets-10!

## Performance

!begin-bullets-11!

-   `x[i, j] <- one_row_value` avoids explicit recycling of the
    right-hand side, the recycling happens implicitly in
    `vctrs::vec_assign()` for performance (#922).

!end-bullets-11!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-12!

-   Vignettes are now tested with a snapshot test (#919).
-   `new_tibble()` uses `vctrs::new_data_frame()` internally (#726,
    @DavisVaughan).
-   Adapt to pillar 1.6.2.
-   Fix tests for compatibility with pillar 1.6.2.

!end-bullets-12!

# tibble 3.1.3

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-13!

-   `tbl[row, col] <- rhs` treats an all-`NA` logical vector as a
    missing value both for existing data (#773) and for the right-hand
    side value (#868). This means that a column initialized with `NA`
    (of type `logical`) will change its type when a row is updated to a
    value of a different type.
-   `[[<-()` supports symbols (#893).

!end-bullets-13!

## Features

!begin-bullets-14!

-   `as_tibble_row()` supports arbitrary vectors (#797).
-   `enframe()` and `deframe()` support arbitrary vectors (#730).
-   `tibble()` and `tibble_row()` ignore all columns that evaluate to
    `NULL`, not only those where a verbatim `NULL` is passed (#895,
    #900).
-   `new_tibble()` is now faster (#901, @mgirlich).

!end-bullets-14!

## Internal

    (#475).

-   `size_sum()` is now reexported from pillar (#850, @topepo).

-   `as_tibble()` hints more often to use the `.name_repair` argument if
    column names are invalid (#855).

-   `as_tibble.table()` mentions `.name_repair` argument in the error
    message (#839).

!end-bullets-19!

!end-bullets-20!

# tibble 3.0.6

!begin-bullets-21!

-   `vec_ptype_abbr.tbl_df()` and `type_sum.tbl_df()` now uses the name
    of the topmost class for subclasses of `"tbl_df"` (#843).
-   Ignore errors in `formats.Rmd` vignette.
-   Avoid tidy evaluation in pillar compatibility code.

!end-bullets-21!

!end-bullets-22!

# tibble 3.0.4

## Compatibility

!begin-bullets-23!

-   Establish compatibility with upcoming pillar 1.5.0 (#818).

-   `tbl_sum()` shows "data frame" instead of "tibble" for objects
    inheriting from `"tbl"` but not `"tbl_df"` (#818).

-   Register `format.tbl()` and `print.tbl()` methods only if pillar
    doesn't (#816).

-   Use `vctrs::num_as_location()` internally for subset assignment of
    rows and columns for better error messages (#746).

!begin-bullets-26!

-   `[[` works with classed indexes again, e.g.Â created with
    `glue::glue()` (#778).

-   `add_column()` works without warning for 0-column data frames
    (#786).

-   `tribble()` now better handles named inputs (#775) and objects of
    non-vtrs classes like `lubridate::Period` (#784) and
    `formattable::formattable` (#785).

!end-bullets-26!

## Performance

!begin-bullets-27!

-   Subsetting and subassignment are faster (#780, #790, #794).

-   `is.null()` is preferred over `is_null()` for speed.

-   Implement continuous benchmarking (#793).

!end-bullets-27!

## Compatibility

!begin-bullets-28!

-   `is_vector_s3()` is no longer reexported from pillar (#789).

!end-bullets-28!

# tibble 3.0.1

-   `[<-.tbl_df()` coerces matrices to data frames (#762).

-   Use delayed import for cli to work around unload problems in
    downstream packages (#754).

!end-bullets-29!

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-30!

-   More soft-deprecation warnings are actually visible.

-   If `.name_repair` is a function, no repair messages are shown
    (#763).

-   Remove superseded signal for `as_tibble.list()`, because
    `as_tibble_row()` only works for size 1.

!end-bullets-30!

## Enhancements

!begin-bullets-31!

-   `as_tibble(validate = )` now always triggers a deprecation warning.

-   Subsetting and subassignment of rows with one-column matrices work
    again, with a deprecation warning (#760).

-   Attempts to update a tibble row with an atomic vector give a clearer
    error message. Recycling message for subassignment appears only if
    target size is != 1.

-   Tweak title of "Invariants" vignette.

!end-bullets-31!

# tibble 3.0.0

## Major breaking changes

!begin-bullets-32!

-   Subset assignment ("subassignment") and also subsetting has become
    stricter. Symptoms:

    !begin-bullets-33!
    -   Error: No common type for ...

    -   Error: Assigned data `...` must be compatible with ...

    -   `i` must have one dimension, not 2

    -   Error: Lossy cast from ... to ...

    !end-bullets-33!
    The "invariants" article at
    https://tibble.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/invariants.html describes
    the invariants that the operations follow in tibble, and the most
    important differences to data frames. We tried to make subsetting
    and subassignment as safe as possible, so that errors are caught
    early on, while introducing as little friction as possible.

-   List classes are no longer automatically treated as vectors.
    Symptoms:

    !begin-bullets-34!
    -   Error: All columns in a tibble must be vectors

    -   Error: Expected a vector, not a `...` object

    !end-bullets-34!
    If you implement a class that wraps a list as S3 vector, you need to
    include `"list"` in the class:

    ``` r
    structure(x, class = c("your_s3_class", "list"))
    ```

    Alternatively, implement a `vec_proxy()` method as described in
    https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/vec_data.html, or construct your
    class with `list_of()`.

-   Added experimental support for inner names for all columns, of the
    form `tibble(a = c(b = 1))`. Inner names are no longer stripped when
    creating a tibble. They are maintained for slicing operations but
    not yet updated when assigning with a row subscript. This is a
    change that may break existing comparison tests that don't expect
    names in columns (#630). Symptoms:

    !begin-bullets-35!
    -   "names for target but not for current" when comparing

    !end-bullets-35!

!end-bullets-32!

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-36!

-   `tibble()` now splices anonymous data frames,
    `tibble(tibble(a = 1), b = a)` is equivalent to
    `tibble(a = 1, b = a)`. This means that `tibble(trees)` now has
    three columns, use `tibble(trees = trees)` if the intention is to
    create a packed data frame (#581).

-   The `name-repair` help topic is gone, refer to
    `?vctrs::vec_as_names` instead.

-   `expression()` columns are converted to lists as a workaround for
    lacking support in vctrs (#657).

-   `tribble()` is now stricter when combining values. All values in a
    column must be compatible, otherwise an error occurs (#204). The
    criteria for wrapping in a list column are now based on vctrs
    principles: non-vectors or vectors with `vctrs::vec_size()` unequal
    1 are wrapped in lists.

-   `$` warns unconditionally if column not found, `[[` doesn't warn.

-   `add_row()` now uses `vctrs::vec_rbind()` under the hood, this means
    that all columns are combined with `vctrs::vec_c()`. In particular,
    factor columns will be converted to character if one of the columns
    is a character column.

!end-bullets-36!

## Soft deprecations

!begin-bullets-37!

-   Soft-deprecate `subclass` argument to `new_tibble()`.

-   Soft-deprecate `as_tibble()` without arguments (#683).

-   Preparing to move `glimpse()` and `tbl_sum()` to the pillar package.
    If your package implements these methods, please import the generics
    from pillar as soon as they become available there.

!end-bullets-37!

## Features

!begin-bullets-38!

-   Internals now make heavy use of the vctrs package, following most of
    the invariants defined there. Name repair is the responsibility of
    vctrs now (#464).

-   All errors emitted directly by the package inherit from the
    `"tibble_error"` and `"rlang_error"` classes. In some cases,
    `"vctrs_error"` errors may be passed through. The exact subclass is
    subject to change.

    Example: `tibble(a = quote(b))` raises an error that inherits from
    `"tibble_error_column_must_be_vector"`, `"tibble_error"` and
    `"rlang_error"`, and from `"error"` and `"condition"` like all
    errors. Do not rely on the wording of
    `"tibble_error_column_must_be_vector"`, this is likely to change.

    Use the following pattern to catch errors emitted by tibble:

    ``` r
    tryCatch(
      your_code(),
      tibble_error = function(cnd) {
      }
    )
    ```

-   New `tibble_row()` constructs tibbles that have exactly one row, or
    fails. Non-vector objects are automatically wrapped in a list,
    vectors (including lists) must have length one (#205).

-   New `as_tibble_row()` and `as_tibble_col()` convert a bare vector to
    a one-row or one-column tibble, respectively. `as_tibble_col()` also
    works for non-bare vectors. Using `as_tibble()` for bare vectors is
    superseded (#447).

-   `as_tibble.data.frame()` uses implicit row names if asked to create
    a column from row names. This allows lossless direct conversion of
    matrices with row names to tibbles (#567, @stufield).

-   Implement `str.tbl_df()` (#480).

-   `tribble()` now returns columns with `"unspecified"` type for 0-row
    tibbles.

-   `add_row()` and `add_column()` now restore attributes to avoid
    errors when appending to sf objects or other tibble subclasses
    (#662).

-   `add_column()` gains `.name_repair` argument. If not given, `.data`
    must have unique columns, with a deprecation message.

-   Allow `POSIXlt` columns, they are now better supported by dplyr and
    other tools thanks to vctrs (#626).

-   `tibble()` ignores NULL arguments, named or unnamed (#580).

-   `view()` works for remote data sources by applying the same strategy
    as `print()` and `glimpse()`. The maximum number of rows in this
    case can be specified using the new `n` argument, by default it is
    taken from the new `"tibble.view_max"` option (#695).

!end-bullets-38!

## Output

!begin-bullets-39!

-   Formatting dimensions never uses scientific notation.

-   `glimpse()` uses "Rows" and "Columns" instead of "Variables" and
    "Observations", because we're not sure if the data is tidy here
    (#614).

-   `view()` now uses the created (or passed) title argument (#610,
    @xvrdm).

!end-bullets-39!

## Performance

!begin-bullets-40!

-   Construction and subsetting of large data frames is faster now
    (#717, @romainfrancois).

!end-bullets-40!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-41!

-   Import lifecycle package (#669).

-   `new_tibble()` removes redundant subclasses from the `"class"`
    attribute.

-   Using classed conditions. All classes start with `"tibble_error_"`
    and also contain `"tibble_error"` (#659).

-   The magrittr pipe `%>%` is reexported.

!end-bullets-41!

# tibble 2.1.3

!begin-bullets-42!

-   Fix compatibility with R 3.5 and earlier, regression introduced in
    tibble 2.1.2.

!end-bullets-42!

# tibble 2.1.2

!begin-bullets-43!

-   Relax version requirements.

-   Fix test failing after pillar upgrade.

!end-bullets-43!

# tibble 2.1.1

!begin-bullets-44!

-   Three dots are used even for `"unique"` name repair (#566).

-   `add_row()`, `add_case()` and `add_column()` now signal a warning
    once per session if the input is not a data frame (#575).

-   Fix `view()` for the case when an object named `x` exists in the
    global environment (#579).

!end-bullets-44!

# tibble 2.0.1

!begin-bullets-45!

-   tibble names can again be set to `NULL` within RStudio, as some R
    routines within RStudio relied on this behaviour (#563,
    @kevinushey).

-   `as_tibble.matrix(validate = TRUE)` works again, with a lifecycle
    warning (#558).

-   Replace `new_list_along()` by `rep_along()` to support rlang 0.3.1
    (#557, @lionel-).

!end-bullets-45!

# tibble 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

The `tibble()` and `as_tibble()` functions, and the low-level
`new_tibble()` constructor, have undergone a major overhaul to improve
consistency. We suspect that package code will be affected more than
analysis code.

To improve compatibility with existing code, breaking changes were
reduced to a minimum and in some cases replaced with a warning that
appears once per session. Call `tibble:::scoped_lifecycle_errors()` when
updating your packages or scripts to the new semantics API to turn these
warnings into errors. The compatibility code will be removed in tibble
3.0.0.

!begin-bullets-46!

-   All optional arguments have moved past the ellipsis, and must be
    specified as named arguments. This affects mostly the `n` argument
    to `as_tibble.table()`, passing `n` unnamed still works (with a
    warning).

-   `new_tibble()` has been optimized for performance, the function no
    longer strips dimensions from 1d arrays and no longer checks
    correctness of names or column lengths. (It still checks if the
    object is named, except for zero-length input.) Use the new
    `validate_tibble()` if you need these checks (#471).

-   The `nrow` argument to `new_tibble()` is now mandatory. The `class`
    argument replaces the now deprecated `subclass` argument, the latter
    will be supported quietly for some time (#518).

-   Setting names on a tibble via `names(df) <- ...` now also requires
    minimal names, otherwise a warning is issued once per session
    (#466).

-   In `as_tibble()`, checking names is also enabled by default, even
    for tibbles, matrices and other matrix-like objects: names must
    exist, `NA` names are not allowed. Coercing a matrix without column
    names will trigger a warning once per session. (This corresponds to
    the `"minimal"` checks described below.).

-   The `validate` argument to `as_tibble()` has been deprecated, see
    below for alternatives. (The `as_tibble.tbl_df()` method has been
    removed, the `as_tibble.data.frame()` method will be used for
    tibbles.)

-   `as_tibble()` always checks that all columns are 1D or 2D vectors
    and not of type `POSIXlt`, even with `validate = FALSE` (which is
    now deprecated).

-   Calling `as_tibble()` on a vector now warns once per session. Use
    `enframe(name = NULL)` for converting a vector to a one-column
    tibble, or `enframe()` for converting a named vector to a two-column
    tibble.

-   `data_frame()` and `frame_data()` are soft-deprecated, please use
    `tibble()` or `tribble()` (#111).

-   `tibble_()`, `data_frame_()`, and `lst_()` are soft-deprecated.
    Please use `tibble()` or `lst()` (#111, #509).

-   `as.tibble()` and `as_data_frame()` are officially deprecated and
    not generic anymore, please use/implement `as_tibble()` (#111).

-   `as_tibble.data.frame()` (and also `as_tibble.matrix()`) strip row
    names by default. Code that relies on tibbles keeping row names now
    will see:

    !begin-bullets-47!
    -   a different result when calling `rownames()` or `row.names()`,
    -   rows full of `NA` values when subsetting rows with with a
        character vector, e.g.Â `as_tibble(mtcars)["Mazda RX4", ]`.

    !end-bullets-47!
    Call `pkgconfig::set_config("tibble::rownames", NA)` to revert to
    the old behavior of keeping row names. Packages that import *tibble*
    can call `set_config()` in their `.onLoad()` function (#114).

-   `as_tibble()` drops extra classes, in particular
    `as_tibble.grouped_df()` now removes grouping (#535).

-   `column_to_rownames()` now always coerces to a data frame, because
    row names are no longer supported in tibbles (#114).

-   In all `*_rownames()` functions, the first argument has been renamed
    to `.data` for consistency (#412).

-   Subsetting one row with `[..., , drop = TRUE]` returns a tibble
    (#442).

-   The `print.tbl_df()` method has been removed, the `print.tbl()`
    method handles printing (#519).

!end-bullets-46!

## New features

!begin-bullets-48!

-   `tibble()` supports columns that are matrices or data frames (#416).

-   The new `.rows` argument to `tibble()` and `as_tibble()` allows
    specifying the expected number of rows explicitly, even if it's
    evident from the data. This allows writing more defensive code.

-   Column name repair has more direct support, via the new
    `.name_repair` argument to `tibble()` and `as_tibble()`. It takes
    the following values:

    !begin-bullets-49!
    -   `"minimal"`: No name repair or checks, beyond basic existence.
    -   `"unique"`: Make sure names are unique and not empty.
    -   `"check_unique"`: (default value), no name repair, but check
        they are `unique`.
    -   `"universal"`: Make the names `unique` and syntactic.
    -   a function: apply custom name repair (e.g.,
        `.name_repair = make.names` or
        `.name_repair = ~make.names(., unique = TRUE)` for names in the
        style of base R).

    !end-bullets-49!
    The `validate` argument of `as_tibble()` is deprecated but supported
    (emits a message once per session). Use `.name_repair = "minimal"`
    instead of `validate = FALSE`, and `.name_repair = "check_unique"`
    instead of `validate = TRUE`. If you need to support older versions
    of tibble, pass both `.name_repair` and `validate` arguments in a
    consistent way, no message will be emitted in this case (#469,
    @jennybc).

-   Row name handling is stricter. Row names are never (and never were)
    supported in `tibble()` and `new_tibble()`, and are now stripped by
    default in `as_tibble()`. The `rownames` argument to `as_tibble()`
    supports:

    !begin-bullets-50!
    -   `NULL`: remove row names (default),
    -   `NA`: keep row names,
    -   A string: the name of the new column that will contain the
        existing row names, which are no longer present in the result.

    !end-bullets-50!
    The old default can be restored by calling
    `pkgconfig::set_config("tibble::rownames", NA)`, this also works for
    packages that import *tibble*.

-   `new_tibble()` and `as_tibble()` now also strip the `"dim"`
    attribute from columns that are one-dimensional arrays. (`tibble()`
    already did this before.)

-   Internally, all `as_tibble()` implementation forward all extra
    arguments and `...` to `as_tibble.list()` where they are handled.
    This means that the common `.rows` and `.name_repair` can be used
    for all inputs. We suggest that your implementations of this method
    do the same.

-   `enframe()` (with `name = NULL`) and `deframe()` now support
    one-column tibbles (#449).

-   Improved S4 support by adding `exportClass(tbl_df)` to `NAMESPACE`
    (#436, @jeffreyhanson and @javierfajnolla).

-   New `validate_tibble()` checks a tibble for internal consistency
    (#471).

-   Bring error message for invalid column type in line with allowed
    matrix/df cols (#465, @maxheld83).

!end-bullets-48!

## New functions

!begin-bullets-51!

-   Added experimental `view()` function that always returns its input
    invisibly and calls `utils::View()` only in interactive mode (#373).

!end-bullets-51!

## Output

!begin-bullets-52!

-   The `set_tidy_names()` and `tidy_names()` helpers the list of new
    names using a bullet list with at most six items (#406).

-   A one-character ellipse (`cli::symbol$ellipsis`) is printed instead
    of `"..."` where available, this affects `glimpse()` output and
    truncated lists (#403).

-   Column names and types are now formatted identically with
    `glimpse()` and `print.tbl_df()`.

-   `tidy_names()` quotes variable names when reporting on repair
    (#407).

-   All error messages now follow the tidyverse style guide (#223).

-   `as_tibble()` prints an informative error message when using the
    `rownames` argument and the input data frame or matrix does not have
    row names (#388, @anhqle).

-   `column_to_rownames()` uses the real variable name in its error
    message (#399, @alexwhan).

-   Lazy tibbles with exactly 10 rows no longer show "...with more rows"
    (#371).

-   `glimpse()` shows information obtained from `tbl_sum()`,
    e.g.Â grouping information for `grouped_df` from dplyr (#550).

!end-bullets-52!

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-53!

-   `glimpse()` takes coloring into account when computing column width,
    the output is no longer truncated prematurely when coloring is
    enabled.

-   `glimpse()` disambiguates outputs for factors if the levels contain
    commas (#384, @anhqle).

-   `print.tbl_df()` with a negative value for `n` behaves as if `n` was
    omitted (#371).

-   Fixed output for extra column names that contain spaces.

!end-bullets-53!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-54!

-   Skip dplyr in tests if unavailable (#420, @QuLogic).

-   Skip mockr in tests if unavailable (#454, @Enchufa2).

-   Use `fansi::strwrap_ctl()` instead of own string wrapping routine.

-   `tibble()` uses recycled values during construction but unrecycled
    values for validation.

-   `tibble()` is now faster for very wide tibbles.

-   Subsetting with the `[` operator is faster (#544).

-   Avoid use of `stop()` in examples if packages are not installed
    (#453, @Enchufa2).

-   Fix `as_tibble()` examples by using correct argument names in
    `requireNamespace()` call (#424, @michaelweylandt).

-   `as_tibble()` checks column length only once (#365, @anhqle).

-   Using `rlang::list2()` (#391, @lionel-).

!end-bullets-54!

# tibble 1.4.2

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-55!

-   Fix OS X builds.
-   The `tibble.width` option is honored again (#369).
-   `tbl[1, , drop = TRUE]` now behaves identically to data frames
    (#367).
-   Fix error message when accessing columns using a logical index
    vector (#337, @mundl).
-   `glimpse()` returns its input for zero-column data frames.

!end-bullets-55!

## Features

!begin-bullets-56!

-   `enframe(NULL)` now returns the same as `enframe(logical())` (#352).
-   `tribble()` now ignores trailing commas (#342, @anhqle).
-   Updated vignettes and website documentation.

!end-bullets-56!

## Performance

!begin-bullets-57!

-   Faster printing of very wide tibbles (#360).
-   Faster construction and subsetting for tibbles (#353).
-   Only call `nrow()` and `head()` in `glimpse()`, not `ncol()`.

!end-bullets-57!

# tibble 1.4.1

## New formatting

The new pillar package is now responsible for formatting tibbles. Pillar
will try to display as many columns as possible, if necessary truncating
or shortening the output. Colored output highlights important
information and guides the eye. The vignette in the tibble package
describes how to adapt custom data types for optimal display in a
tibble.

## New features

!begin-bullets-58!

-   Make `add_case()` an alias for `add_row()` (#324, @LaDilettante).
-   `as_tibble()` gains `rownames` argument (#288, #289).
-   `as_tibble.matrix()` repairs column names.
-   Tibbles now support character subsetting (#312).
-   `` `[.tbl_df`() `` supports `drop = TRUE` and omits the warning if
    `j` is passed. The calls `df[i, j, drop = TRUE]` and
    `df[j, drop = TRUE]` are now compatible with data frames again
    (#307, #311).

!end-bullets-58!

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-59!

-   Improved compatibility with remote data sources for `glimpse()`
    (#328).
-   Logical indexes are supported, a warning is raised if the length
    does not match the number of rows or 1 (#318).
-   Fixed width for word wrapping of the extra information (#301).
-   Prevent `add_column()` from dropping classes and attributes by
    removing the use of `cbind()`. Additionally this ensures that
    `add_column()` can be used with grouped data frames (#303,
    @DavisVaughan).
-   `add_column()` to an empty zero-row tibble with a variable of
    nonzero length now produces a correct error message (#319).

!end-bullets-59!

## Internal changes

!begin-bullets-60!

-   Reexporting `has_name()` from rlang, instead of forwarding, to avoid
    warning when importing both rlang and tibble.
-   Compatible with R 3.1 (#323).
-   Remove Rcpp dependency (#313, @patperry).

!end-bullets-60!

# tibble 1.3.4

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-61!

-   Values of length 1 in a `tibble()` call are recycled prior to
    evaluating subsequent arguments, improving consistency with
    `mutate()` (#213).
-   Recycling of values of length 1 in a `tibble()` call maintains their
    class (#284).
-   `add_row()` now always preserves the column data types of the input
    data frame the same way as `rbind()` does (#296).
-   `lst()` now again handles duplicate names, the value defined last is
    used in case of a clash.
-   Adding columns to zero-row data frames now also works when mixing
    lengths 1 and 0 in the new columns (#167).
-   The `validate` argument is now also supported in
    `as_tibble.tbl_df()`, with default to `FALSE` (#278). It must be
    passed as named argument, as in `as_tibble(validate = TRUE)`.

!end-bullets-61!

## Formatting

!begin-bullets-62!

-   `format_v()` now always surrounds lists with `[]` brackets, even if
    their length is one. This affects `glimpse()` output for list
    columns (#106).
-   Factor levels are escaped when printing (#277).
-   Non-syntactic names are now also escaped in `glimpse()` (#280).
-   `tibble()` gives a consistent error message in the case of duplicate
    column names (#291).

!end-bullets-62!

# tibble 1.3.3

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-63!

-   Added `format()` and `print()` methods for both `tbl` and `tbl_df`
    classes, to protect against malformed tibbles that inherit from
    `"tbl_df"` but not `"tbl"`, as created e.g.Â by `ungroup()` in dplyr
    0.5.0 and earlier (#256, #263).
-   The column width for non-syntactic columns is computed correctly
    again (#258).
-   Printing a tibble doesn't apply quote escaping to list columns.
-   Fix error in `tidy_names(syntactic = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)` if not
    all names are fixed (#260, @imanuelcostigan).
-   Remove unused import declaration for assertthat.

!end-bullets-63!

# tibble 1.3.1

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-64!

-   Subsetting zero columns no longer returns wrong number of rows
    (#241, @echasnovski).

!end-bullets-64!

## Interface changes

!begin-bullets-65!

-   New `set_tidy_names()` and `tidy_names()`, a simpler version of
    `repair_names()` which works unchanged for now (#217).
-   New `rowid_to_column()` that adds a `rowid` column as first column
    and removes row names (#243, @barnettjacob).
-   The `all.equal.tbl_df()` method has been removed, calling
    `all.equal()` now forwards to `base::all.equal.data.frame()`. To
    compare tibbles ignoring row and column order, please use
    `dplyr::all_equal()` (#247).

!end-bullets-65!

## Formatting

!begin-bullets-66!

-   Printing now uses `x` again instead of the Unicode multiplication
    sign, to avoid encoding issues (#216).
-   String values are now quoted when printing if they contain
    non-printable characters or quotes (#253).
-   The `print()`, `format()`, and `tbl_sum()` methods are now
    implemented for class `"tbl"` and not for `"tbl_df"`. This allows
    subclasses to use tibble's formatting facilities. The formatting of
    the header can be tweaked by implementing `tbl_sum()` for the
    subclass, which is expected to return a named character vector. The
    `print.tbl_df()` method is still implemented for compatibility with
    downstream packages, but only calls `NextMethod()`.
-   Own printing routine, not relying on `print.data.frame()` anymore.
    Now providing `format.tbl_df()` and full support for Unicode
    characters in names and data, also for `glimpse()` (#235).

!end-bullets-66!

## Misc

!begin-bullets-67!

-   Improve formatting of error messages (#223).
-   Using `rlang` instead of `lazyeval` (#225, @lionel-), and `rlang`
    functions (#244).
-   `tribble()` now handles values that have a class (#237, @NikNakk).
-   Minor efficiency gains by replacing `any(is.na())` with `anyNA()`
    (#229, @csgillespie).
-   The `microbenchmark` package is now used conditionally (#245).
-   `pkgdown` website.

!end-bullets-67!

# tibble 1.3.0

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-68!

-   Time series matrices (objects of class `mts` and `ts`) are now
    supported in `as_tibble()` (#184).
-   The `all_equal()` function (called by `all.equal.tbl_df()`) now
    forwards to `dplyr` and fails with a helpful message if not
    installed. Data frames with list columns cannot be compared anymore,
    and differences in the declared class (`data.frame` vs.Â `tbl_df`)
    are ignored. The `all.equal.tbl_df()` method gives a warning and
    forwards to `NextMethod()` if `dplyr` is not installed; call
    `all.equal(as.data.frame(...), ...)` to avoid the warning. This
    ensures consistent behavior of this function, regardless if `dplyr`
    is loaded or not (#198).

!end-bullets-68!

## Interface changes

!begin-bullets-69!

-   Now requiring R 3.1.0 instead of R 3.1.3 (#189).
-   Add `as.tibble()` as an alias to `as_tibble()` (#160,
    @LaDilettante).
-   New `frame_matrix()`, similar to `frame_data()` but for matrices
    (#140, #168, @LaDilettante).
-   New `deframe()` as reverse operation to `enframe()` (#146, #214).
-   Removed unused dependency on `assertthat`.

!end-bullets-69!

## Features

### General

!begin-bullets-70!

-   Keep column classes when adding row to empty tibble (#171, #177,
    @LaDilettante).
-   Singular and plural variants for error messages that mention a list
    of objects (#116, #138, @LaDilettante).
-   `add_column()` can add columns of length 1 (#162, #164,
    @LaDilettante).

!end-bullets-70!

### Input validation

!begin-bullets-71!

-   An attempt to read or update a missing column now throws a clearer
    warning (#199).
-   An attempt to call `add_row()` for a grouped data frame results in a
    helpful error message (#179).

!end-bullets-71!

### Printing

!begin-bullets-72!

-   Render Unicode multiplication sign as `x` if it cannot be
    represented in the current locale (#192, @ncarchedi).
-   Backtick `NA` names in printing (#206, #207, @jennybc).
-   `glimpse()` now uses `type_sum()` also for S3 objects (#185, #186,
    @holstius).
-   The `max.print` option is ignored when printing a tibble (#194,
    #195, @t-kalinowski).

!end-bullets-72!

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-73!

-   Fix typo in `obj_sum` documentation (#193, @etiennebr).
-   Reword documentation for `tribble()` (#191, @kwstat).
-   Now explicitly stating minimum Rcpp version 0.12.3.

!end-bullets-73!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-74!

-   Using registration of native routines.

!end-bullets-74!

# tibble 1.2

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-75!

-   The `tibble.width` option is used for `glimpse()` only if it is
    finite (#153, @kwstat).
-   New `as_tibble.poly()` to support conversion of a `poly` object to a
    tibble (#110).
-   `add_row()` now correctly handles existing columns of type `list`
    that are not updated (#148).
-   `all.equal()` doesn't throw an error anymore if one of the columns
    is named `na.last`, `decreasing` or `method` (#107, @BillDunlap).

!end-bullets-75!

## Interface changes

!begin-bullets-76!

-   New `add_column()`, analogously to `add_row()` (#99).
-   `print.tbl_df()` gains `n_extra` method and will have the same
    interface as `trunc_mat()` from now on.
-   `add_row()` and `add_column()` gain `.before` and `.after` arguments
    which indicate the row (by number) or column (by number or name)
    before or after which the new data are inserted. Updated or added
    columns cannot be named `.before` or `.after` (#99).
-   Rename `frame_data()` to `tribble()`, stands for "transposed
    tibble". The former is still available as alias (#132, #143).

!end-bullets-76!

## Features

!begin-bullets-77!

-   `add_row()` now can add multiple rows, with recycling (#142,
    @jennybc).
-   Use multiply character `Ã` instead of `x` when printing dimensions
    (#126). Output tests had to be disabled for this on Windows.
-   Back-tick non-semantic column names on output (#131).
-   Use `dttm` instead of `time` for `POSIXt` values (#133), which is
    now used for columns of the `difftime` class.
-   Better output for 0-row results when total number of rows is unknown
    (e.g., for SQL data sources).

!end-bullets-77!

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-78!

-   New object summary vignette that shows which methods to define for
    custom vector classes to be used as tibble columns (#151).
-   Added more examples for `print.tbl_df()`, now using data from
    `nycflights13` instead of `Lahman` (#121), with guidance to install
    `nycflights13` package if necessary (#152).
-   Minor changes in vignette (#115, @helix123).

!end-bullets-78!

# tibble 1.1

Follow-up release.

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-79!

-   `tibble()` is no longer an alias for `frame_data()` (#82).
-   Remove `tbl_df()` (#57).
-   `$` returns `NULL` if column not found, without partial matching. A
    warning is given (#109).
-   `[[` returns `NULL` if column not found (#109).

!end-bullets-79!

## Output

!begin-bullets-80!

-   Reworked output: More concise summary (begins with hash `#` and
    contains more text (#95)), removed empty line, showing number of
    hidden rows and columns (#51). The trailing metadata also begins
    with hash `#` (#101). Presence of row names is indicated by a star
    in printed output (#72).
-   Format `NA` values in character columns as `<NA>`, like
    `print.data.frame()` does (#69).
-   The number of printed extra cols is now an option (#68, @lionel-).
-   Computation of column width properly handles wide (e.g., Chinese)
    characters, tests still fail on Windows (#100).
-   `glimpse()` shows nesting structure for lists and uses angle
    brackets for type (#98).
-   Tibbles with `POSIXlt` columns can be printed now, the text
    `<POSIXlt>` is shown as placeholder to encourage usage of `POSIXct`
    (#86).
-   `type_sum()` shows only topmost class for S3 objects.

!end-bullets-80!

## Error reporting

!begin-bullets-81!

-   Strict checking of integer and logical column indexes. For integers,
    passing a non-integer index or an out-of-bounds index raises an
    error. For logicals, only vectors of length 1 or `ncol` are
    supported. Passing a matrix or an array now raises an error in any
    case (#83).
-   Warn if setting non-`NULL` row names (#75).
-   Consistently surround variable names with single quotes in error
    messages.
-   Use "Unknown column 'x'" as error message if column not found, like
    base R (#94).
-   `stop()` and `warning()` are now always called with `call. = FALSE`.

!end-bullets-81!

## Coercion

!begin-bullets-82!

-   The `.Dim` attribute is silently stripped from columns that are 1d
    matrices (#84).
-   Converting a tibble without row names to a regular data frame does
    not add explicit row names.
-   `as_tibble.data.frame()` preserves attributes, and uses
    `as_tibble.list()` to calling overriden methods which may lead to
    endless recursion.

!end-bullets-82!

## New features

!begin-bullets-83!

-   New `has_name()` (#102).
-   Prefer `tibble()` and `as_tibble()` over `data_frame()` and
    `as_data_frame()` in code and documentation (#82).
-   New `is.tibble()` and `is_tibble()` (#79).
-   New `enframe()` that converts vectors to two-column tibbles (#31,
    #74).
-   `obj_sum()` and `type_sum()` show `"tibble"` instead of `"tbl_df"`
    for tibbles (#82).
-   `as_tibble.data.frame()` gains `validate` argument (as in
    `as_tibble.list()`), if `TRUE` the input is validated.
-   Implement `as_tibble.default()` (#71, hadley/dplyr#1752).
-   `has_rownames()` supports arguments that are not data frames.

!end-bullets-83!

## Bug fixes

!begin-bullets-84!

-   Two-dimensional indexing with `[[` works (#58, #63).
-   Subsetting with empty index (e.g., `x[]`) also removes row names.

!end-bullets-84!

## Documentation

!begin-bullets-85!

-   Document behavior of `as_tibble.tbl_df()` for subclasses (#60).
-   Document and test that subsetting removes row names.

!end-bullets-85!

## Internal

!begin-bullets-86!

-   Don't rely on `knitr` internals for testing (#78).
-   Fix compatibility with `knitr` 1.13 (#76).
-   Enhance `knit_print()` tests.
-   Provide default implementation for `tbl_sum.tbl_sql()` and
    `tbl_sum.tbl_grouped_df()` to allow `dplyr` release before a
    `tibble` release.
-   Explicit tests for `format_v()` (#98).
-   Test output for `NULL` value of `tbl_sum()`.
-   Test subsetting in all variants (#62).
-   Add missing test from dplyr.
-   Use new `expect_output_file()` from `testthat`.

!end-bullets-86!

# Version 1.0

!begin-bullets-87!

-   Initial CRAN release

-   Extracted from `dplyr` 0.4.3

-   Exported functions:

    !begin-bullets-88!
    -   `tbl_df()`
    -   `as_data_frame()`
    -   `data_frame()`, `data_frame_()`
    -   `frame_data()`, `tibble()`
    -   `glimpse()`
    -   `trunc_mat()`, `knit_print.trunc_mat()`
    -   `type_sum()`
    -   New `lst()` and `lst_()` create lists in the same way that
        `data_frame()` and `data_frame_()` create data frames
        (hadley/dplyr#1290). `lst(NULL)` doesn't raise an error (#17,
        @jennybc), but always uses deparsed expression as name (even for
        `NULL`).
    -   New `add_row()` makes it easy to add a new row to data frame
        (hadley/dplyr#1021).
    -   New `rownames_to_column()` and `column_to_rownames()` (#11,
        @zhilongjia).
    -   New `has_rownames()` and `remove_rownames()` (#44).
    -   New `repair_names()` fixes missing and duplicate names (#10,
        #15, @r2evans).
    -   New `is_vector_s3()`.

    !end-bullets-88!

-   Features

    !begin-bullets-89!
    -   New `as_data_frame.table()` with argument `n` to control name of
        count column (#22, #23).
    -   Use `tibble` prefix for options (#13, #36).
    -   `glimpse()` now (invisibly) returns its argument
        (hadley/dplyr#1570). It is now a generic, the default method
        dispatches to `str()` (hadley/dplyr#1325). The default width is
        obtained from the `tibble.width` option (#35, #56).
    -   `as_data_frame()` is now an S3 generic with methods for lists
        (the old `as_data_frame()`), data frames (trivial), matrices
        (with efficient C++ implementation) (hadley/dplyr#876), and
        `NULL` (returns a 0-row 0-column data frame) (#17, @jennybc).
    -   Non-scalar input to `frame_data()` and `tibble()` (including
        lists) creates list-valued columns (#7). These functions return
        0-row but n-col data frame if no data.

    !end-bullets-89!

-   Bug fixes

    !begin-bullets-90!
    -   `frame_data()` properly constructs rectangular tables
        (hadley/dplyr#1377, @kevinushey).

    !end-bullets-90!

-   Minor modifications

    !begin-bullets-91!
    -   Uses `setOldClass(c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))` to help
        with S4 (hadley/dplyr#969).
    -   `tbl_df()` automatically generates column names
        (hadley/dplyr#1606).
    -   `tbl_df`s gain `$` and `[[` methods that are \~5x faster than
        the defaults, never do partial matching (hadley/dplyr#1504), and
        throw an error if the variable does not exist. `[[.tbl_df()`
        falls back to regular subsetting when used with anything other
        than a single string (#29). `base::getElement()` now works with
        tibbles (#9).
    -   `all_equal()` allows to compare data frames ignoring row and
        column order, and optionally ignoring minor differences in type
        (e.g.Â int vs.Â double) (hadley/dplyr#821). Used by `all.equal()`
        for tibbles. (This package contains a pure R implementation of
        `all_equal()`, the `dplyr` code has identical behavior but is
        written in C++ and thus faster.)
    -   The internals of `data_frame()` and `as_data_frame()` have been
        aligned, so `as_data_frame()` will now automatically recycle
        length-1 vectors. Both functions give more informative error
        messages if you are attempting to create an invalid data frame.
        You can no longer create a data frame with duplicated names
        (hadley/dplyr#820). Both functions now check that you don't have
        any `POSIXlt` columns, and tell you to use `POSIXct` if you do
        (hadley/dplyr#813). `data_frame(NULL)` raises error "must be a
        1d atomic vector or list".
    -   `trunc_mat()` and `print.tbl_df()` are considerably faster if
        you have very wide data frames. They will now also only list the
        first 100 additional variables not already on screen - control
        this with the new `n_extra` parameter to `print()`
        (hadley/dplyr#1161). The type of list columns is printed
        correctly (hadley/dplyr#1379). The `width` argument is used also
        for 0-row or 0-column data frames (#18).
    -   When used in list-columns, S4 objects only print the class name
        rather than the full class hierarchy (#33).
    -   Add test that `[.tbl_df()` does not change class (#41,
        @jennybc). Improve `[.tbl_df()` error message.
