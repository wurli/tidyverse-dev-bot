# tidyr (development version)

!begin-bullets-1!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()` gains a new `.vary` argument, allowing users to
    control whether the first column varies fastest or slowest (#1543,
    @JamesHWade).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unite()` no longer errors if you provide a selection that doesn't
    select any columns. Instead, it returns a column containing the
    empty string (#1548, @catalamarti).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider_spec()` now throws a more informative error on non-data
    frame inputs (@catalamarti, #1510).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    tidyr now requires dplyr \>=1.1.0 (#1568, @catalamarti).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-1!

# tidyr 1.3.1

!begin-bullets-2!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider` now uses `.by` and `|>` syntax for the dplyr helper
    message to identify duplicates (@boshek, #1516)
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-2!

# tidyr 1.3.0

## New features

!begin-bullets-3!

-   !begin-bullet!
    New family of consistent string separating functions:
    `separate_wider_delim()`, `separate_wider_position()`,
    `separate_wider_regex()`, `separate_longer_delim()`, and
    `separate_longer_position()`. These functions are thorough refreshes
    of `separate()` and `extract()`, featuring improved performance,
    greater consistency, a polished API, and a new approach for handling
    problems. They use stringr and supersede `extract()`, `separate()`,
    and `separate_rows()` (#1304).

    The named character vector interface used in
    `separate_wider_regex()` is very similar to the nc package by Toby
    Dylan Hocking.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` gains a `.by` argument which allows you to specify the
    columns to nest by (rather than the columns to nest, i.e.Â through
    `...`). Additionally, the `.key` argument is no longer deprecated,
    and is used whenever `...` isn't specified (#1458).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_longer()` gains a `keep_empty` argument like `unnest()`
    (#1339).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` gains a `cols_vary` argument for controlling the
    ordering of the output rows relative to their original row number
    (#1312).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    New datasets `who2`, `household`, `cms_patient_experience`, and
    `cms_patient_care` to demonstrate various tidying challenges
    (#1333).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-3!

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-4!

-   !begin-bullet!
    The `...` argument of both `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` has
    been moved to the front of the function signature, after the
    required arguments but before the optional ones. Additionally,
    `pivot_longer_spec()`, `pivot_wider_spec()`, `build_longer_spec()`,
    and `build_wider_spec()` have all gained `...` arguments in a
    similar location. This change allows us to more easily add new
    features to the pivoting functions without breaking existing CRAN
    packages and user scripts.

    `pivot_wider()` provides temporary backwards compatible support for
    the case of a single unnamed argument that previously was being
    positionally matched to `id_cols`. This one special case still
    works, but will throw a warning encouraging you to explicitly name
    the `id_cols` argument.

    To read more about this pattern, see
    https://design.tidyverse.org/dots-after-required.html (#1350).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-4!

## Lifecycle changes

!begin-bullets-5!

-   !begin-bullet!
    All functions deprecated in tidyr 1.0 and 1.2 (the old lazyeval
    functions ending in `_` and various arguments to `unnest()`) now
    warn on every use. They will be made defunct in 2024 (#1406).
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-5!

## Rectangling

!begin-bullets-6!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_longer()` now consistently drops rows with either `NULL` or
    empty vectors (like `integer()`) by default. Set the new
    `keep_empty` argument to `TRUE` to retain them. Previously,
    `keep_empty = TRUE` was implicitly being used for `NULL`, while
    `keep_empty = FALSE` was being used for empty vectors, which was
    inconsistent with all other tidyr verbs with this argument (#1363).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_longer()` now uses `""` in the index column for fully
    unnamed vectors. It also now consistently uses `NA` in the index
    column for empty vectors that are "kept" by `keep_empty = TRUE`
    (#1442).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` now errors if any values being unnested are unnamed
    and `names_sep` is not provided (#1367).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` now generates automatic names for *partially*
    unnamed vectors. Previously it only generated them for fully unnamed
    vectors, resulting in a strange mix of automatic names and
    name-repaired names (#1367).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-6!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

### General

!begin-bullets-7!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Most tidyr functions now consistently disallow renaming during
    tidy-selection. Renaming was never meaningful in these functions,
    and previously either had no effect or caused problems (#1449,
    #1104).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    tidyr errors (including input validation) have been thoroughly
    reviewed and should generally be more likely to point you in the
    right direction (#1313, #1400).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `uncount()` is now generic so implementations can be provided for
    objects other than data frames (@mgirlich, #1358).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `uncount()` gains a `...` argument. It comes between the required
    and the optional arguments (@mgirlich, #1358).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()`, `complete()`, `expand()`, and `fill()` now document their
    support for grouped data frames created by `dplyr::group_by()`
    (#952).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    All built in datasets are now standard tibbles (#1459).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    R \>=3.4.0 is now required, in line with the tidyverse standard of
    supporting the previous 5 minor releases of R.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    rlang \>=1.0.4 and vctrs \>=0.5.2 are now required (#1344, #1470).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Removed dependency on ellipsis in favor of equivalent functions in
    rlang (#1314).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-7!

### Nesting, packing, and chopping

!begin-bullets-8!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()`, `unchop()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`
    better handle lists with additional classes (#1327).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pack()`, `unpack()`, `chop()`, and `unchop()` all gain an
    `error_call` argument, which in turn improves some of the error
    calls shown in `nest()` and various `unnest()` adjacent functions
    (#1446).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `chop()`, `unpack()`, and `unchop()` all gain `...`, which must be
    empty (#1447).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unpack()` does a better job of reporting column name duplication
    issues and gives better advice about how to resolve them using
    `names_sep`. This also improves errors from functions that use
    `unpack()`, like `unnest()` and `unnest_wider()` (#1425, #1367).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-8!

### Pivoting

!begin-bullets-9!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` no longer supports interpreting
    `values_ptypes = list()` and `names_ptypes = list()` as `NULL`. An
    empty `list()` is now interpreted as a `<list>` prototype to apply
    to all columns, which is consistent with how any other 0-length
    value is interpreted (#1296).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer(values_drop_na = TRUE)` is faster when there aren't
    any missing values to drop (#1392, @mgirlich).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` is now more memory efficient due to the usage of
    `vctrs::vec_interleave()` (#1310, @mgirlich).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` now throws a slightly better error message when
    `values_ptypes` or `names_ptypes` is provided and the coercion can't
    be made (#1364).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` now throws a better error message when a column
    selected by `names_from` or `values_from` is also selected by
    `id_cols` (#1318).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` is now faster when `names_sep` is provided
    (@mgirlich, #1426).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer_spec()`, `pivot_wider_spec()`, `build_longer_spec()`,
    and `build_wider_spec()` all gain an `error_call` argument,
    resulting in better error reporting in `pivot_longer()` and
    `pivot_wider()` (#1408).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-9!

### Missing values

!begin-bullets-10!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` now works correctly when there is a column named
    `.direction` in `data` (#1319, @tjmahr).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `replace_na()` is faster when there aren't any missing values to
    replace (#1392, @mgirlich).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The documentation of the `replace` argument of `replace_na()` now
    mentions that `replace` is always cast to the type of `data`
    (#1317).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-10!

# tidyr 1.2.1

!begin-bullets-11!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Hot patch release to resolve R CMD check failures.
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-11!

# tidyr 1.2.0

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-12!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` and `expand()` no longer allow you to complete or
    expand on a grouping column. This was never well-defined since
    completion/expansion on a grouped data frame happens "within" each
    group and otherwise has the potential to produce erroneous results
    (#1299).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `replace_na()` no longer allows the type of `data` to change when
    the replacement is applied. `replace` will now always be cast to the
    type of `data` before the replacement is made. For example, this
    means that using a replacement value of `1.5` on an integer column
    is no longer allowed. Similarly, replacing missing values in a
    list-column must now be done with `list("foo")` rather than just
    `"foo"`.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-12!

## Pivoting

!begin-bullets-13!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` gains new `names_expand` and `id_expand` arguments
    for turning implicit missing factor levels and variable combinations
    into explicit ones. This is similar to the `drop` argument from
    `spread()` (#770).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` gains a new `names_vary` argument for controlling
    the ordering when combining `names_from` values with `values_from`
    column names (#839).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` gains a new `unused_fn` argument for controlling how
    to summarize unused columns that aren't involved in the pivoting
    process (#990, thanks to @mgirlich for an initial implementation).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()`'s `names_transform` and `values_transform`
    arguments now accept a single function which will be applied to all
    of the columns (#1284, thanks to @smingerson for an initial
    implementation).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()`'s `names_ptypes` and `values_ptypes` arguments now
    accept a single empty ptype which will be applied to all of the
    columns (#1284).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-13!

## Nesting

!begin-bullets-14!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` and `unchop()`'s `ptype` argument now accepts a single
    empty ptype which will be applied to all `cols` (#1284).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unpack()` now silently skips over any non-data frame columns
    specified by `cols`. This matches the existing behavior of
    `unchop()` and `unnest()` (#1153).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-14!

## Rectangling

!begin-bullets-15!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` and `unnest_longer()` can now unnest multiple
    columns at once (#740).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_longer()`'s `indices_to` and `values_to` arguments now
    accept a glue specification, which is useful when unnesting multiple
    columns.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    For `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`, if a `ptype`
    is supplied, but that column can't be simplified, the result will be
    a list-of column where each element has type `ptype` (#998).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` gains a new `strict` argument which controls
    whether or not strict vctrs typing rules should be applied. It
    defaults to `FALSE` for backwards compatibility, and because it is
    often more useful to be lax when unnesting JSON, which doesn't
    always map one-to-one with R's types (#1125).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `simplify`
    argument now accepts a named list of `TRUE` or `FALSE` to control
    simplification on a per column basis (#995).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `transform`
    argument now accepts a single function which will be applied to all
    components (#1284).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `ptype`
    argument now accepts a single empty ptype which will be applied to
    all components (#1284).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-15!

## Grids

!begin-bullets-16!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` gains a new `explicit` argument for limiting `fill` to
    only implicit missing values. This is useful if you don't want to
    fill in pre-existing missing values (#1270).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` gains a grouped data frame method. This generates a
    more correct completed data frame when groups are involved (#396,
    #966).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-16!

## Missing values

!begin-bullets-17!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `drop_na()`, `replace_na()`, and `fill()` have been updated to
    utilize vctrs. This means that you can use these functions on a
    wider variety of column types, including lubridate's Period types
    (#1094), data frame columns, and the rcrd type from vctrs.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `replace_na()` no longer replaces empty atomic elements in
    list-columns (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is replaced in
    a list-column is `NULL` (#1168).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `drop_na()` no longer drops empty atomic elements from list-columns
    (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is dropped in a list-column
    is `NULL` (#1228).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-17!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

### General

!begin-bullets-18!

-   !begin-bullet!
    @mgirlich is now a tidyr author in recognition of his significant
    and sustained contributions.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    All lazyeval variants of tidyr verbs have been soft-deprecated.
    Expect them to move to the defunct stage in the next minor release
    of tidyr (#1294).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `any_of()` and `all_of()` from tidyselect are now re-exported
    (#1217).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    dplyr \>= 1.0.0 is now required.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-18!

### Pivoting

!begin-bullets-19!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` now gives better advice about how to identify
    duplicates when values are not uniquely identified (#1113).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` now throws a more informative error when `values_fn`
    doesn't result in a single summary value (#1238).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` now generate more informative
    errors related to name repair (#987).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` now works correctly when `values_fill` is a data
    frame.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` no longer accidentally retains `values_from` when
    pivoting a zero row data frame (#1249).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` now correctly handles the case where an id column
    name collides with a value from `names_from` (#1107).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` now both check that the spec
    columns `.name` and `.value` are character vectors. Additionally,
    the `.name` column must be unique (#1107).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()`'s `names_from` and `values_from` arguments are now
    required if their default values of `name` and `value` don't
    correspond to columns in `data`. Additionally, they must identify at
    least 1 column in `data` (#1240).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()`'s `values_fn` argument now correctly allows
    anonymous functions (#1114).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider_spec()` now works correctly with a 0-row data frame and
    a `spec` that doesn't identify any rows (#1250, #1252).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()`'s `names_ptypes` argument is now applied after
    `names_transform` for consistency with the rectangling functions
    (i.e.Â `hoist()`) (#1233).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `check_pivot_spec()` is a new developer facing function for
    validating a pivot `spec` argument. This is only useful if you are
    extending `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()` with new S3 methods
    (#1087).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-19!

### Nesting

!begin-bullets-20!

-   !begin-bullet!
    The `nest()` generic now avoids computing on `.data`, making it more
    compatible with lazy tibbles (#1134).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The `.names_sep` argument of the data.frame method for `nest()` is
    now actually used (#1174).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()`'s `ptype` argument now works as expected (#1158).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unpack()` no longer drops empty columns specified through `cols`
    (#1191).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unpack()` now works correctly with data frame columns containing 1
    row but 0 columns (#1189).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `chop()` now works correctly with data frames with 0 rows (#1206).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `chop()`'s `cols` argument is no longer optional. This matches the
    behavior of `cols` seen elsewhere in tidyr (#1205).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unchop()` now respects `ptype` when unnesting a non-list column
    (#1211).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-20!

### Rectangling

!begin-bullets-21!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `hoist()` no longer accidentally removes elements that have
    duplicated names (#1259).
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-21!

### Grids

!begin-bullets-22!

-   !begin-bullet!
    The grouped data frame methods for `complete()` and `expand()` now
    move the group columns to the front of the result (in addition to
    the columns you completed on or expanded, which were already moved
    to the front). This should make more intuitive sense, as you are
    completing or expanding "within" each group, so the group columns
    should be the first thing you see (#1289).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` now applies `fill` even when no columns to complete are
    specified (#1272).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` now correctly retain `NA`
    values of factors (#1275).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now
    silently apply name repair to automatically named inputs. This
    avoids a number of issues resulting from duplicate truncated names
    (#1116, #1221, #1092, #1037, #992).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now allow
    columns from unnamed data frames to be used in expressions after
    that data frame was specified, like
    `expand_grid(tibble(x = 1), y = x)`. This is more consistent with
    how `tibble()` behaves.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now work
    correctly with data frames containing 0 columns but \>0 rows
    (#1189).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now
    return a 1 row data frame when no inputs are supplied, which is more
    consistent with `prod() == 1L` and the idea that computations
    involving the number of combinations computed from an empty set
    should return 1 (#1258).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-22!

### Missing values

!begin-bullets-23!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `drop_na()` no longer drops missing values from all columns when a
    tidyselect expression that results in 0 columns being selected is
    used (#1227).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` now treats `NaN` like any other missing value (#982).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-23!

# tidyr 1.1.4

!begin-bullets-24!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_grid()` is now about twice as fast and `pivot_wider()` is a
    bit faster (@mgirlich, #1130).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unchop()` is now much faster, which propagates through to various
    functions, such as `unnest()`, `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`,
    and `separate_rows()` (@mgirlich, @DavisVaughan, #1127).

    !end-bullet!

    `unnest()` is now much faster (@mgirlich, @DavisVaughan, #1127).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` no longer allows unnesting a list-col containing a mix of
    vector and data frame elements. Previously, this only worked by
    accident, and is considered an off-label usage of `unnest()` that
    has now become an error.

# tidyr 1.1.0

## General features

!begin-bullets-28!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()`, `hoist()`, `unnest_wider()`, and `unnest_longer()`
    gain new `transform` arguments; these allow you to transform values
    "in flight". They are partly needed because vctrs coercion rules
    have become stricter, but they give you greater flexibility than was
    available previously (#921).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Arguments that use tidy selection syntax are now clearly documented
    and have been updated to use tidyselect 1.1.0 (#872).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-28!

## Pivoting improvements

!begin-bullets-29!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Both `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are considerably more
    performant, thanks largely to improvements in the underlying vctrs
    code (#790, @DavisVaughan).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` now supports `names_to = character()` which
    prevents the name column from being created (#961).

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` {r}
    df <- tibble(id = 1:3, x_1 = 1:3, x_2 = 4:6)
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_to = character())
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` no longer creates a `.copy` variable in the
    presence of duplicate column names. This makes it more consistent
    with the handling of non-unique specs.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` automatically disambiguates non-unique ouputs,
    which can occur when the input variables include some additional
    component that you don't care about and want to discard (#792,
    #793).

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` {r}
    df <- tibble(id = 1:3, x_1 = 1:3, x_2 = 4:6)
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_pattern = "(.)_.")
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_sep = "_", names_to = c("name", NA))
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_sep = "_", names_to = c(".value", NA))
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` gains a `names_sort` argument which allows you to
    sort column names in order. The default, `FALSE`, orders columns by
    their first appearance (#839). In a future version, I'll consider
    changing the default to `TRUE`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` gains a `names_glue` argument that allows you to
    construct output column names with a glue specification.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` arguments `values_fn` and `values_fill` can now be
    single values; you now only need to use a named list if you want to
    use different values for different value columns (#739, #746). They
    also get improved errors if they're not of the expected type.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-29!

## Rectangling

!begin-bullets-30!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `hoist()` now automatically names pluckers that are a single string
    (#837). It error if you use duplicated column names (@mgirlich,
    #834), and now uses `rlang::list2()` behind the scenes (which means
    that you can now use `!!!` and `:=`) (#801).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, and `hoist()` do a better job
    simplifying list-cols. They no longer add unneeded `unspecified()`
    when the result is still a list (#806), and work when the list
    contains non-vectors (#810, #848).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider(names_sep = "")` now provides default names for
    unnamed inputs, suppressing the many previous name repair messages
    (#742).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-30!

## Nesting

!begin-bullets-31!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pack()` and `nest()` gains a `.names_sep` argument allows you to
    strip outer names from inner names, in symmetrical way to how the
    same argument to `unpack()` and `unnest()` combines inner and outer
    names (#795, #797).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` and `unnest_longer()` can now unnest `list_of`
    columns. This is important for unnesting columns created from
    `nest()` and with `pivot_wider()`, which will create `list_of`
    columns if the id columns are non-unique (#741).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-31!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

!begin-bullets-32!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `chop()` now creates list-columns of class `vctrs::list_of()`. This
    helps keep track of the type in case the chopped data frame is
    empty, allowing `unchop()` to reconstitute a data frame with the
    correct number and types of column even when there are no
    observations.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `drop_na()` now preserves attributes of unclassed vectors (#905).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()`, `expand_grid()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` once
    again evaluate their inputs iteratively, so you can refer to freshly
    created columns, e.g.Â `crossing(x = seq(-2, 2), y = x)` (#820).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()`, `expand_grid()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` gain a
    `.name_repair` giving you control over their name repair strategy
    (@jeffreypullin, #798).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()` lets you use `NA` in `into`, as documented (#793).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()`, `separate()`, `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and
    `unnest_wider()` give a better error message if `col` is missing
    (#805).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pack()`'s first argument is now `.data` instead of `data` (#759).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` now errors if `values_to` is not a length-1
    character vector (#949).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` are now generic so
    implementations can be provided for objects other than data frames
    (#800).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `pivot_wider()` can now pivot data frame columns (#926)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unite(na.rm = TRUE)` now works for all types of variable, not just
    character vectors (#765).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_wider()` gives a better error message if you attempt to
    unnest multiple columns (#740).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_auto()` works when the input data contains a column called
    `col` (#959).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-32!

# tidyr 1.0.0

## Breaking changes

See `vignette("in-packages")` for a detailed transition guide.

!begin-bullets-35!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` and `unnest()` have new syntax. The majority of existing
    usage should be automatically translated to the new syntax with a
    warning. If that doesn't work, put this in your script to use the
    old versions until you can take a closer look and update your code:

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` r
    library(tidyr)
    nest <- nest_legacy
    unnest <- unnest_legacy
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` now preserves grouping, which has implications for
    downstream calls to group-aware functions, such as `dplyr::mutate()`
    and `filter()`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The first argument of `nest()` has changed from `data` to `.data`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` uses the emerging tidyverse standard to disambiguate
    unique names. Use `names_repair = tidyr_legacy` to request the
    previous approach.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest_()`/`nest_()` and the lazyeval methods for
    `unnest()`/`nest()` are now defunct. They have been deprecated for
    some time, and, since the interface has changed, package authors
    will need to update to avoid deprecation warnings. I think one clean
    break should be less work for everyone.

    All other lazyeval functions have been formally deprecated, and will
    be made defunct in the next major release. (See lifecycle vignette
    for details on deprecation stages).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `crossing()` and `nesting()` now return 0-row outputs if any input
    is a length-0 vector. If you want to preserve the previous behaviour
    which silently dropped these inputs, you should convert empty
    vectors to `NULL`. (More discussion on this general pattern at
    https://github.com/tidyverse/principles/issues/24)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-35!

## Pivoting

New `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` provide modern alternatives to
`spread()` and `gather()`. They have been carefully redesigned to be
easier to learn and remember, and include many new features. Learn more
in `vignette("pivot")`.

These functions resolve multiple existing issues with
`spread()`/`gather()`. Both functions now handle mulitple value columns
(#149/#150), support more vector types (#333), use tidyverse conventions
for duplicated column names (#496, #478), and are symmetric (#453).
`pivot_longer()` gracefully handles duplicated column names (#472), and
can directly split column names into multiple variables. `pivot_wider()`
can now aggregate (#474), select keys (#572), and has control over
generated column names (#208).

To demonstrate how these functions work in practice, tidyr has gained
several new datasets: `relig_income`, `construction`, `billboard`,
`us_rent_income`, `fish_encounters` and `world_bank_pop`.

Finally, tidyr demos have been removed. They are dated, and have been
superseded by `vignette("pivot")`.

## Rectangling

tidyr contains four new functions to support **rectangling**, turning a
deeply nested list into a tidy tibble: `unnest_longer()`,
`unnest_wider()`, `unnest_auto()`, and `hoist()`. They are documented in
a new vignette: `vignette("rectangle")`.

`unnest_longer()` and `unnest_wider()` make it easier to unnest
list-columns of vectors into either rows or columns (#418).
`unnest_auto()` automatically picks between `_longer()` and `_wider()`
using heuristics based on the presence of common names.

New `hoist()` provides a convenient way of plucking components of a
list-column out into their own top-level columns (#341). This is
particularly useful when you are working with deeply nested JSON,
because it provides a convenient shortcut for the `mutate()` + `map()`
pattern:

!begin-codeblock!

``` {r}
df %>% hoist(metadata, name = "name")
# shortcut for
df %>% mutate(name = map_chr(metadata, "name"))
```

!end-codeblock!

## Nesting

`nest()` and `unnest()` have been updated with new interfaces that are
more closely aligned to evolving tidyverse conventions. They use the
theory developed in vctrs to more consistently handle mixtures of input
types, and their arguments have been overhauled based on the last few
years of experience. They are supported by a new `vignette("nest")`,
which outlines some of the main ideas of nested data (it's still very
rough, but will get better over time).

The biggest change is to their operation with multiple columns:
`df %>% unnest(x, y, z)` becomes `df %>% unnest(c(x, y, z))` and
`df %>% nest(x, y, z)` becomes `df %>% nest(data = c(x, y, z))`.

I have done my best to ensure that common uses of `nest()` and
`unnest()` will continue to work, generating an informative warning
telling you precisely how you need to update your code. Please file an
issue if I've missed an important use case.

`unnest()` has been overhauled:

!begin-bullets-36!

-   !begin-bullet!
    New `keep_empty` parameter ensures that every row in the input gets
    at least one row in the output, inserting missing values as needed
    (#358).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Provides `names_sep` argument to control how inner and outer column
    names are combined.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Uses standard tidyverse name-repair rules, so by default you will
    get an error if the output would contain multiple columns with the
    same name. You can override by using `name_repair` (#514).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Now supports `NULL` entries (#436).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-36!

## Packing and chopping

Under the hood, `nest()` and `unnest()` are implemented with `chop()`,
`pack()`, `unchop()`, and `unpack()`:

!begin-bullets-37!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `pack()` and `unpack()` allow you to pack and unpack columns into
    data frame columns (#523).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `chop()` and `unchop()` chop up rows into sets of list-columns.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-37!

Packing and chopping are interesting primarily because they are the
atomic operations underlying nesting (and similarly, unchop and
unpacking underlie unnesting), and I don't expect them to be used
directly very often.

## New features

!begin-bullets-38!

-   !begin-bullet!
    New `expand_grid()`, a tidy version of `expand.grid()`, is
    lower-level than the existing `expand()` and `crossing()` functions,
    as it takes individual vectors, and does not sort or uniquify them.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `crossing()`, `nesting()`, and `expand()` have been rewritten to use
    the vctrs package. This should not affect much existing code, but
    considerably simplifies the implementation and ensures that these
    functions work consistently across all generalised vectors (#557).
    As part of this alignment, these functions now only drop `NULL`
    inputs, not any 0-length vector.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-38!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

!begin-bullets-39!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `full_seq()` now also works when gaps between observations are
    shorter than the given `period`, but are within the tolerance given
    by `tol`. Previously, gaps between consecutive observations had to
    be in the range \[`period`, `period + tol`\]; gaps can now be in the
    range \[`period - tol`, `period + tol`\] (@ha0ye, #657).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    tidyr now re-exports `tibble()`, `as_tibble()`, and `tribble()`, as
    well as the tidyselect helpers (`starts_with()`, `ends_with()`,
    ...). This makes generating documentation, reprexes, and tests
    easier, and makes tidyr easier to use without also attaching dplyr.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    All functions that take `...` have been instrumented with functions
    from the ellipsis package to warn if you've supplied arguments that
    are ignored (typically because you've misspelled an argument name)
    (#573).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` now uses `full_join()` so that all levels are preserved
    even when not all levels are specified (@Ryo-N7, #493).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `crossing()` now takes the unique values of data frame inputs, not
    just vector inputs (#490).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gather()` throws an error if a column is a data frame (#553).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()` (and hence `pivot_longer()`) can extract multiple input
    values into a single output column (#619).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` is now implemented using `dplyr::mutate_at()`. This
    radically simplifies the implementation and considerably improves
    performance when working with grouped data (#520).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` now accepts `downup` and `updown` as fill directions
    (@coolbutuseless, #505).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unite()` gains `na.rm` argument, making it easier to remove missing
    values prior to uniting values together (#203)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-39!

# tidyr 0.8.3

!begin-bullets-40!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `crossing()` preserves factor levels (#410), now works with
    list-columns (#446, @SamanthaToet). (These also help `expand()`
    which is built on top of `crossing()`)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` is compatible with dplyr 0.8.0.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` works when the id variable has names (#525).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` preserves column being unnested when input is zero-length
    (#483), using `list_of()` attribute to correctly restore columns,
    where possible.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` will run with named and unnamed list-columns of same
    length (@hlendway, #460).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-40!

# tidyr 0.8.2

!begin-bullets-41!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` now accepts `NA` as a column name in the `into`
    argument to denote columns which are omitted from the result.
    (@markdly, #397).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Minor updates to ensure compatibility with dependencies.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-41!

# tidyr 0.8.1

!begin-bullets-42!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` weakens test of "atomicity" to restore previous behaviour
    when unnesting factors and dates (#407).
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-42!

# tidyr 0.8.0

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-43!

-   !begin-bullet!
    There are no deliberate breaking changes in this release. However, a
    number of packages are failing with errors related to numbers of
    elements in columns, and row names. It is possible that these are
    accidental API changes or new bugs. If you see such an error in your
    package, I would sincerely appreciate a minimal reprex.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` now correctly uses -1 to refer to the far right
    position, instead of -2. If you depended on this behaviour, you'll
    need to switch on `packageVersion("tidyr") > "0.7.2"`

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-43!

## New features

!begin-bullets-44!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Increased test coverage from 84% to 99%.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `uncount()` performs the inverse operation of `dplyr::count()`
    (#279)

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-44!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

!begin-bullets-45!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete(data)` now returns `data` rather than throwing an error
    (#390). `complete()` with zero-length completions returns original
    input (#331).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `crossing()` preserves `NA`s (#364).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()` with empty input gives empty data frame instead of `NULL`
    (#331).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()`, `crossing()`, and `complete()` now complete empty
    factors instead of dropping them (#270, #285)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()` has a better error message if `regex` does not contain
    the expected number of groups (#313).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `drop_na()` no longer drops columns (@jennybryan, #245), and works
    with list-cols (#280). Equivalent of `NA` in a list column is any
    empty (length 0) data structure.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` is now faster, especially when a long data frame is
    collapsed into a nested data frame with few rows.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` on a zero-row data frame works as expected (#320).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `replace_na()` no longer complains if you try and replace missing
    values in variables not present in the data (#356).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `replace_na()` now also works with vectors (#342, @flying-sheep),
    and can replace `NULL` in list-columns. It throws a better error
    message if you attempt to replace with something other than length
    1.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` no longer checks that `...` is empty, allowing methods
    to make use of it. This check was added in tidyr 0.4.0 (2016-02-02)
    to deprecate previous behaviour where `...` was passed to
    `strsplit()`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` and `extract()` now insert columns in correct position
    when `drop = TRUE` (#394).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` now works correctly counts from RHS when using negative
    integer `sep` values (@markdly, #315).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` gets improved warning message when pieces aren't as
    expected (#375).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate_rows()` supports list columns (#321), and works with empty
    tibbles.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` now consistently returns 0 row outputs for 0 row inputs
    (#269).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` now works when `key` column includes `NA` and `drop` is
    `FALSE` (#254).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!

# tidyr 0.7.1

This is a hotfix release to account for some tidyselect changes in the
unit tests.

Note that the upcoming version of tidyselect backtracks on some of the
changes announced for 0.7.0. The special evaluation semantics for
selection have been changed back to the old behaviour because the new
rules were causing too much trouble and confusion. From now on data
expressions (symbols and calls to `:` and `c()`) can refer to both
registered variables and to objects from the context.

However the semantics for context expressions (any calls other than to
`:` and `c()`) remain the same. Those expressions are evaluated in the
context only and cannot refer to registered variables. If you're writing
functions and refer to contextual objects, it is still a good idea to
avoid data expressions by following the advice of the 0.7.0 release
notes.

# tidyr 0.7.0

This release includes important changes to tidyr internals. Tidyr now
supports the new tidy evaluation framework for quoting (NSE) functions.
It also uses the new tidyselect package as selecting backend.

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-47!

-   !begin-bullet!
    If you see error messages about objects or functions not found, it
    is likely because the selecting functions are now stricter in their
    arguments An example of selecting function is `gather()` and its
    `...` argument. This change makes the code more robust by
    disallowing ambiguous scoping. Consider the following code:

    !begin-codeblock!
        x <- 3
        df <- tibble(w = 1, x = 2, y = 3)
        gather(df, "variable", "value", 1:x)

    !end-codeblock!
    Does it select the first three columns (using the `x` defined in the
    global environment), or does it select the first two columns (using
    the column named `x`)?

    To solve this ambiguity, we now make a strict distinction between
    data and context expressions. A data expression is either a bare
    name or an expression like `x:y` or `c(x, y)`. In a data expression,
    you can only refer to columns from the data frame. Everything else
    is a context expression in which you can only refer to objects that
    you have defined with `<-`.

    In practice this means that you can no longer refer to contextual
    objects like this:

    !begin-codeblock!
        mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:ncol(mtcars))

        x <- 3
        mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:x)
        mtcars %>% gather(var, value, -(1:x))

    !end-codeblock!
    You now have to be explicit about where to find objects. To do so,
    you can use the quasiquotation operator `!!` which will evaluate its
    argument early and inline the result:

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` {r}
    mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:ncol(mtcars))
    mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:x)
    mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! -(1:x))
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    An alternative is to turn your data expression into a context
    expression by using `seq()` or `seq_len()` instead of `:`. See the
    section on tidyselect for more information about these semantics.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Following the switch to tidy evaluation, you might see warnings
    about the "variable context not set". This is most likely caused by
    supplying helpers like `everything()` to underscored versions of
    tidyr verbs. Helpers should be always be evaluated lazily. To fix
    this, just quote the helper with a formula:
    `drop_na(df,   ~everything())`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The selecting functions are now stricter when you supply integer
    positions. If you see an error along the lines of

    !begin-codeblock!
        `-0.949999999999999`, `-0.940000000000001`, ... must resolve to
        integer column positions, not a double vector

    !end-codeblock!
    please round the positions before supplying them to tidyr. Double
    vectors are fine as long as they are rounded.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-47!

## Switch to tidy evaluation

tidyr is now a tidy evaluation grammar. See the programming vignette in
dplyr for practical information about tidy evaluation.

The tidyr port is a bit special. While the philosophy of tidy evaluation
is that R code should refer to real objects (from the data frame or from
the context), we had to make some exceptions to this rule for tidyr. The
reason is that several functions accept bare symbols to specify the
names of *new* columns to create (`gather()` being a prime example).
This is not tidy because the symbol do not represent any actual object.
Our workaround is to capture these arguments using `rlang::quo_name()`
(so they still support quasiquotation and you can unquote symbols or
strings). This type of NSE is now discouraged in the tidyverse: symbols
in R code should represent real objects.

Following the switch to tidy eval the underscored variants are softly
deprecated. However they will remain around for some time and without
warning for backward compatibility.

## Switch to the tidyselect backend

The selecting backend of dplyr has been extracted in a standalone
package tidyselect which tidyr now uses for selecting variables. It is
used for selecting multiple variables (in `drop_na()`) as well as single
variables (the `col` argument of `extract()` and `separate()`, and the
`key` and `value` arguments of `spread()`). This implies the following
changes:

!begin-bullets-48!

-   !begin-bullet!
    The arguments for selecting a single variable now support all
    features from `dplyr::pull()`. You can supply a name or a position,
    including negative positions.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Multiple variables are now selected a bit differently. We now make a
    strict distinction between data and context expressions. A data
    expression is either a bare name of an expression like `x:y` or
    `c(x, y)`. In a data expression, you can only refer to columns from
    the data frame. Everything else is a context expression in which you
    can only refer to objects that you have defined with `<-`.

    You can still refer to contextual objects in a data expression by
    being explicit. One way of being explicit is to unquote a variable
    from the environment with the tidy eval operator `!!`:

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` r
    x <- 2
    drop_na(df, 2)     # Works fine
    drop_na(df, x)     # Object 'x' not found
    drop_na(df, !! x)  # Works as if you had supplied 2
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    On the other hand, select helpers like `start_with()` are context
    expressions. It is therefore easy to refer to objects and they will
    never be ambiguous with data columns:

    !begin-codeblock!
    ``` {r}
    x <- "d"
    drop_na(df, starts_with(x))
    ```

    !end-codeblock!
    While these special rules is in contrast to most dplyr and tidyr
    verbs (where both the data and the context are in scope) they make
    sense for selecting functions and should provide more robust and
    helpful semantics.

-   !begin-bullet!
    `complete()` preserves grouping created by dplyr (#168).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()` (and hence `complete()`) preserves the ordered attribute
    of factors (#165).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `full_seq()` preserve attributes for dates and date/times (#156),
    and sequences no longer need to start at 0.

    !end-bullet!

    `gather()` can now gather together list columns (#175), and
    `gather_.data.frame(na.rm = TRUE)` now only removes missing values
    if they're actually present (#173).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` returns correct output if every variable is nested (#186).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` fills from right-to-left (not left-to-right!) when fill
    = "left" (#170, @dgrtwo).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` and `unite()` now automatically drop removed variables
    from grouping (#159, #177).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` gains a `sep` argument. If not-null, this will name
    columns as "key`<sep>`{=html}value". Additionally, if sep is `NULL`
    missing values will be converted to `<NA>` (#68).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` works in the presence of list-columns (#199)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` works with non-syntactic names (#190).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` gains a `sep` argument. If non-null, this will rename the
    columns of nested data frames to include both the original column
    name, and the nested column name, separated by `.sep` (#184).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` gains `.id` argument that works the same way as
    `bind_rows()`. This is useful if you have a named list of data
    frames or vectors (#125).

!end-bullets-56!

# tidyr 0.4.1

!begin-bullets-57!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed bug in `nest()` where nested data was ending up in the wrong
    row (#158).
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-57!

# tidyr 0.4.0

## Nested data frames

`nest()` and `unnest()` have been overhauled to support a useful way of
structuring data frames: the **nested** data frame. In a grouped data
frame, you have one row per observation, and additional metadata define
the groups. In a nested data frame, you have one **row** per group, and
the individual observations are stored in a column that is a list of
data frames. This is a useful structure when you have lists of other
objects (like models) with one element per group.

!begin-bullets-58!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` now produces a single list of data frames called "data"
    rather than a list column for each variable. Nesting variables are
    not included in nested data frames. It also works with grouped data
    frames made by `dplyr::group_by()`. You can override the default
    column name with `.key`.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` gains a `.drop` argument which controls what happens to
    other list columns. By default, they're kept if the output doesn't
    require row duplication; otherwise they're dropped.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` now has `mutate()` semantics for `...` - this allows you
    to unnest transformed columns more easily. (Previously it used
    select semantics).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-58!

## Expanding

!begin-bullets-59!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()` once again allows you to evaluate arbitrary expressions
    like `full_seq(year)`. If you were previously using `c()` to created
    nested combinations, you'll now need to use `nesting()` (#85, #121).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nesting()` and `crossing()` allow you to create nested and crossed
    data frames from individual vectors. `crossing()` is similar to
    `base::expand.grid()`

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `full_seq(x, period)` creates the full sequence of values from
    `min(x)` to `max(x)` every `period` values.

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-59!

## Minor bug fixes and improvements

!begin-bullets-60!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` fills in `NULL`s in list-columns.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` gains a direction argument so that it can fill either
    upwards or downwards (#114).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gather()` now stores the key column as character, by default. To
    revert to the previous behaviour of using a factor (which allows you
    to preserve the ordering of the columns), use `key_factor = TRUE`
    (#96).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    All tidyr verbs do the right thing for grouped data frames created
    by `group_by()` (#122, #129, #81).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `seq_range()` has been removed. It was never used or announced.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` once again creates columns of mixed type when
    `convert = TRUE` (#118, @jennybc). `spread()` with `drop = FALSE`
    handles zero-length factors (#56). `spread()`ing a data frame with
    only key and value columns creates a one row output (#41).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unite()` now removes old columns before adding new (#89, @krlmlr).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` now warns if defunct ... argument is used (#151,
    @krlmlr).

    !end-bullet!

# tidyr 0.3.1

-   !begin-bullet!
    Fixed bug where attributes of non-gather columns were lost (#104)
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-61!

# tidyr 0.3.0

## New features

!begin-bullets-62!

-   !begin-bullet!
    New `complete()` provides a wrapper around `expand()`, `left_join()`
    and `replace_na()` for a common task: completing a data frame with
    missing combinations of variables.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `fill()` fills in missing values in a column with the last
    non-missing value (#4).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    New `replace_na()` makes it easy to replace missing values with
    something meaningful for your data.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `nest()` is the complement of `unnest()` (#3).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `unnest()` can now work with multiple list-columns at the same time.
    If you don't supply any columns names, it will unlist all
    list-columns (#44). `unnest()` can also handle columns that are
    lists of data frames (#58).

    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-62!

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

!begin-bullets-63!

-   !begin-bullet!
    tidyr no longer depends on reshape2. This should fix issues if you
    also try to load reshape (#88).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `%>%` is re-exported from magrittr.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand()` now supports nesting and crossing (see examples for
    details). This comes at the expense of creating new variables inline
    (#46).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `expand_` does SE evaluation correctly so you can pass it a
    character vector of columns names (or list of formulas etc) (#70).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()` is 10x faster because it now uses stringi instead of
    base R regular expressions. It also returns NA instead of throwing
    an error if the regular expression doesn't match (#72).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract()` and `separate()` preserve character vectors when
    `convert` is TRUE (#99).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The internals of `spread()` have been rewritten, and now preserve
    all attributes of the input `value` column. This means that you can
    now spread date (#62) and factor (#35) inputs.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` gives a more informative error message if `key` or
    `value` don't exist in the input data (#36).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` only displays the first 20 failures (#50). It has finer
    control over what happens if there are two few matches: you can fill
    with missing values on either the "left" or the "right" (#49).
    `separate()` no longer throws an error if the number of pieces
    aren't as expected - instead it uses drops extra values and fills on
    the right and gives a warning.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    If the input is NA `separate()` and `extract()` both return silently
    return NA outputs, rather than throwing an error. (#77)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Experimental `unnest()` method for lists has been removed.

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

!begin-bullets-65!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `extract_numeric()` preserves negative signs (#20).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gather()` has better defaults if `key` and `value` are not
    supplied. If `...` is omitted, `gather()` selects all columns (#28).
    Performance is now comparable to `reshape2::melt()` (#18).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `separate()` gains `extra` argument which lets you control what
    happens to extra pieces. The default is to throw an "error", but you
    can also "merge" or "drop".

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `spread()` gains `drop` argument, which allows you to preserve
    missing factor levels (#25). It converts factor value variables to
    character vectors, instead of embedding a matrix inside the data
    frame (#35).

    !end-bullet!
