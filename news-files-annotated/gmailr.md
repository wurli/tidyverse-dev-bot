## Changes around the OAuth client

!begin-bullets-1!

-   !begin-bullet!
    Set up an OAuth client is a new non-vignette article with detailed
    instructions for creating and configuring an OAuth client.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_default_oauth_client()` is a new helper that searches for the
    JSON file representing an OAuth client in a sequence of locations.
    The (file)path of least resistance is to place this file in the
    directory returned by `rappdirs::user_data_dir("gmailr")`. Another
    alternative is to record its filepath in the `GMAILR_OAUTH_CLIENT`
    environment variable. For backwards compatibility, the `GMAILR_APP`
    environment variable is still consulted, but generates a warning
    (#166).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_auth()` no longer checks for an OAuth client before calling
    `gargle::token_fetch()`. This allows other auth methods to work,
    which by and large don't need an OAuth client, such as
    `gargle::credentials_byo_oauth2()` (#160, #186).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    If `gm_auth()` fails to get a token and no OAuth client has been
    configured, it silently calls `gm_auth_configure()` to make one
    attempt at automatic client discovery. If an OAuth client is indeed
    discovered, `gm_auth()` tries one more time to get a token.

    Since the lack of an OAuth client undoubtedly remains the most
    common reason for `gm_auth()` to fail, its error message includes
    some specific content if no OAuth client has been configured.

    !end-bullet!

## Storing and deploying a token

!begin-bullets-2!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_token_write()` + `gm_token_read()` is a new matched pair of
    functions that make it much easier to explicitly store a token
    obtained in an interactive session then reuse that token elsewhere,
    such in CI or in a deployed product (#190).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The directory
    `system.file("deployed-token-demo", package = "gmailr")` contains a
    working demo of how to use `gm_token_write()` + `gm_token_read()` in
    a deployed Shiny app.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `vignette("deploy-a-token")` is a new vignette describing how to
    capture a token interactively, for later use in a non-interactive
    setting.

    !end-bullet!

## Syncing up with gargle

Versions 1.3.0, 1.4.0, and 1.5.1 of gargle introduced some changes
around OAuth and gmailr is syncing up that:

!begin-bullets-3!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_oauth_client()` is a new function to replace the now-deprecated
    `gm_oauth_app()`. This is somewhat about a vocabulary change
    ("client" instead of "app"), but it's really connected to a more
    meaningful shift in gargle, which has a new appreciation for
    different OAuth client types (e.g., "installed" vs. "web").
    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_oauth_client()` (and the function it's replacing,
    `gm_oauth_app()`) no longer error if there is no configured OAuth
    client.
    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_auth_configure()` has an updated signature:
    !begin-bullets-4!
    -   !begin-bullet!
        The first argument is now named `client`, which is morally
        equivalent to the previous `app`, i.e. this is essentially a
        name change.

        !end-bullet!
    -   !begin-bullet!
        The `key`, `secret`, `appname`, and `app` arguments are
        deprecated.

        !end-bullet!
    -   !begin-bullet!
        Our strong recommendation is to use the `path` argument, either
        explicitly::

        !begin-codeblock!
        ``` r
        gm_auth_configure(path = "path/to/my-oauth-client.json")
        ```

        !end-codeblock!
        or implicitly:

        !begin-codeblock!
        ``` r
        gm_auth_configure()
        ```

        !end-codeblock!
        which works because of the new default:
        `gm_auth_configure(path = gm_default_oauth_client())`.

        !end-bullet!

    !end-bullets-4!
    !end-bullet!

!end-bullets-3!

## Other changes

!begin-bullets-5!

-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_auth(subject =)` is a new argument that can be used with
    `gm_auth(path =)`, i.e. when using a service account. The `path` and
    `subject` arguments are ultimately processed by
    `gargle::credentials_service_account()` and support the use of a
    service account to impersonate a regular user.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    `gm_scopes()` can now take a character vector of scopes, each of
    which can be an actual scope or a short alias, e.g.,
    `"gmail.readonly"`, which identifies a scope associated with the
    Gmail API. When called without arguments, `gm_scopes()` still
    returns a named vector of Gmail API-specific scopes, where the names
    are the associated short aliases.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The deprecation process for legacy functions that lack the `gm_`
    prefix has been advanced. The functions are still present, but throw
    an error directing the user to switch to the prefixed version.

    The unexported helper
    `gmailr:::gm_convert_file(list.files(pattern = "[.]R$", recursive = TRUE))`
    can be used to convert all R files in the current directory to the
    new names (#95).

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    Legacy auth functions `clear_token()`, `gmail_auth()`, and
    `use_secret_file()` now throw an error.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    gmailr no longer `Imports` magrittr and no longer re-exports the
    magrittr pipe (`%>%`). gmailr is a very pipe-friendly package, so
    this was originally done for user convenience (#42).

    Since most users (those using R \>= 4.1) now have access to the base
    pipe (`|>`), that is now what is shown in gmailr's documentation.
    Those using R \< 4.1 can still use gmailr with `magrittr::%>%`, but
    they will need to do `library(magrittr)` for themselves.

    Any gmailr examples that use the base pipe will no longer work on R
    \< 4.1. On affected R versions, the examples are automatically
    converted to a regular section with a note that they might not work.

## Breaking changes

!begin-bullets-7!

-   !begin-bullet!
    All functions are now prefixed with `gm_*()` to avoid name conflicts
    with other packages (including the base package), the previous names
    have been deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Use
    `gmailr:::gm_convert_file(list.files(pattern = "[.]R$", recursive = TRUE))`
    to convert all R files in the current directory to the new names.
    (#95)

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    New `gm_auth_configure()` and `gm_auth()` functions added conforming
    to the conventions in the gargle package. `gmail_auth()`,
    `clear_token()` and `use_secret_token()` are now deprecated and will
    be removed in a future release.

    !end-bullet!
-   !begin-bullet!
    The google application bundled in previous gmailr releases has been
    removed, users will now need to create their own applications in
    order to use gmailr. See the Setup section in the readme for
    details. This was necessary to comply with stricter enforcement of
    the API terms of service.

    !end-bullet!
