ggplot2,eec5607ca1a2d1acc9dfd1a7ecdf15ad,"ggplot2 now supports/uses tidy evaluation (as described below). This is a major change and breaks a number of packages; we made this breaking change because it is important to make ggplot2 more programmable, and to be more consistent with the rest of the tidyverse. The best general (and detailed) introduction to tidy evaluation can be found in the meta programming chapters in Advanced R. The primary developer facing change is that `aes()` now contains quosures (expression + environment pairs) rather than symbols, and you'll need to take a different approach to extracting the information you need. A common symptom of this change are errors ""undefined columns selected"" or ""invalid 'type' (list) of argument"" (#2610). As in the previous version, constants (like `aes(x = 1)` or `aes(colour = ""smoothed"")`) are stored as is. In this version of ggplot2, if you need to describe a mapping in a string, use `quo_name()` (to generate single-line strings; longer expressions may be abbreviated) or `quo_text()` (to generate non-abbreviated strings that may span multiple lines). If you do need to extract the value of a variable instead use `rlang::eval_tidy()`. You may want to condition on `(packageVersion(""ggplot2"") <= ""2.2.1"")` so that your code can work with both released and development versions of ggplot2.

This is the behaviour when `adjust_tz = TRUE` (the default). Although this is in line with general user expectations it can cause issues when the time zone is important, for e.g. when looking at differences between time points, since the underlying numeric data is changed to preserve the displayed time.
