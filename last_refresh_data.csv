ggplot2,240,90a23cb63d28a25ff1eb86eb63da616d,"ggplot2 now supports/uses tidy evaluation (as described below). This is a major change and breaks a number of packages; we made this breaking change because it is important to make ggplot2 more programmable, and to be more consistent with the rest of the tidyverse. The best general (and detailed) introduction to tidy evaluation can be found in the meta programming chapters in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz). The primary developer facing change is that `aes()` now contains quosures (expression + environment pairs) rather than symbols, and you'll need to take a different approach to extracting the information you need. A common symptom of this change are errors ""undefined columns selected"" or ""invalid 'type' (list) of argument"" (#2610). As in the previous version, constants (like `aes(x = 1)` or `aes(colour = ""smoothed"")`) are stored as is. In this version of ggplot2, if you need to describe a mapping in a string, use `quo_name()` (to generate single-line strings; longer expressions may be abbreviated) or `quo_text()` (to generate non-abbreviated strings that may span multiple lines). If you do need to extract the value of a variable instead use `rlang::eval_tidy()`. You may want to condition on `(packageVersion(""ggplot2"") <= ""2.2.1"")` so that your code can work with both released and development versions of ggplot2. We recognise that this is a big change and if you're not already familiar with rlang, there's a lot to learn. If you are stuck, or need any help, please reach out on <https://community.rstudio.com>."

Note that the formula interface is not going away and will not be deprecated. `vars()` is simply meant to make it easier to create functions around `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`. The first two arguments of `facet_grid()` become `rows` and `cols` and now support `vars()` inputs. Note however that we took special care to ensure complete backward compatibility. With this change `facet_grid(vars(cyl), vars(am, vs))` is equivalent to `facet_grid(cyl ~ am + vs)`, and `facet_grid(cols = vars(am, vs))` is equivalent to `facet_grid(. ~ am + vs)`.

ggplot2,471,f15dbf10d1b716671fe9146d9f7bbf98,"Sizes in ggplot2 are measured in mm. Previously they were converted to pts (for use in grid) by multiplying by 72 / 25.4. However, grid uses printer's points, not Adobe (big pts), so sizes are now correctly multiplied by 72.27 / 25.4.

ggplot2,477,1fec1e53bd2d862a0933acd13d40e616,`facet_wrap()` gains a `labeller` option (#25).
ggplot2,478,be4980be29a2328a626b35b0c6519936,"`facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()` gain a `switch` argument to display the facet titles near the axes. When switched, the labels become axes subtitles. `switch` can be set to ""x"", ""y"" or ""both"" (the latter only for grids) to control which margin is switched."
ggplot2,479,8bd5a92577198a88475c4308ab032079,They now offer the `multi_line` argument to control whether to display composite facets (those specified as `~var1 + var2`) on one or multiple lines.
ggplot2,480,d78d66605ee7f57a6ad7e97b4cb18516,"In `label_bquote()` you now refer directly to the names of variables. With this change, you can create math expressions that depend on more than one variable. This math expression can be specified either for the rows or the columns and you can also provide different expressions to each margin. As a consequence of these changes, referring to `x` in backquoted expressions is deprecated."
ggplot2,481,d46ddf77cc5306373056c74a5ae314b2,"Similarly to `label_bquote()`, `labeller()` now take `.rows` and `.cols` arguments. In addition, it also takes `.default`. `labeller()` is useful to customise how particular variables are labelled. The three additional arguments specify how to label the variables are not specifically mentioned, respectively for rows, columns or both. This makes it especially easy to set up a project-wide labeller dispatcher that can be reused across all your plots. See the documentation for an example."
ggplot2,482,5884639dd18237316e21c35ef09752db,"The new labeller `label_context()` adapts to the number of factors facetted over. With a single factor, it displays only the values, just as before. But with multiple factors in a composite margin (e.g. with `~cyl + am`), the labels are passed over to `label_both()`. This way the variables names are displayed with the values to help identifying them."
ggplot2,483,4acab4143686b8d461b65ec67e8fa898,"Previously, a labeller function would take `variable` and `value` arguments and return a character vector. Now, they take a data frame of character vectors and return a list. The input data frame has one column per factor facetted over and each column in the returned list becomes one line in the strip label. See documentation for more details."
ggplot2,484,c6227694db4da35cfc64633b2713bc4c,"The labels received by a labeller now contain metadata: their margin (in the ""type"" attribute) and whether they come from a wrap or a grid facet (in the ""facet"" attribute)."
ggplot2,485,24dd0049405549b7b021eda21eaeac1a,Note that the new `as_labeller()` function operator provides an easy way to transform an existing function to a labeller function. The existing function just needs to take and return a character vector.

This new error helps you detect when `.data` is used in the wrong context. We've noticed several packages failing after this change because they were using `.data` outside of a data-masking context. For instance the `by` argument of `dplyr::join()` is not data-masked. Previously `dplyr::join(by = .data$foo)` would silently be interpreted as `dplyr::join(by = NULL)`. This is now an error. Another issue is using `.data` inside `ggplot2::labs(...)`. This is not allowed since `labs()` isn't data-masked.

We've noticed some packages do not check for `NULL` results from `call_name()`. Note that many complex calls such as `foo()()`, `foo$bar()` don't have a ""name"" and cause a `NULL` result. This is why you should always check for `NULL` results when using `call_name()`. We've added the function `is_call_simple()` to make it easier to work safely with `call_name()`. The invariant is that `call_name()` always returns a string when `is_call_simple()` returns `TRUE`. Conversely it always returns `NULL` when `is_call_simple()` retuns `FALSE`."

In general, passing a function name as a string is brittle. It is easy to forget to pass the user environment to `as_function()` and sometimes there is no obvious user environment. The support for strings should be considered a convenience for end users only, not for programmers. Since environment forwarding is easy to mess up, and since the feature is aimed towards end users, `as_function()` now defaults to the global environment. Supply an environment explicitly if that is not correct in your case."

rlang,334,c65b206d74afcc5c859029fada98e87d,"This caused a number of issues in reverse dependencies as `quo_text()` tends to be used for converting symbols to strings. `quo_text()` and `quo_name()` should not be used for this purpose because they are general purpose deparsers. These functions should generally only be used for printing outputs or creating default labels. If you need to convert symbols to strings, please use `as_string()` rather than `quo_text()`.

rlang,339,b25d7e320c98c276e3ac33a334413755,"`abort()` now records backtraces automatically in the error object. Errors thrown with `abort()` invite users to call `rlang::last_error()` to see a backtrace and help identifying where and why the error occurred. The backtraces created by rlang (you can create one manually with `trace_back()`) are printed in a simplified form by default that removes implementation details from the backtrace. To see the full backtrace, call `summary(rlang::last_error())`. `abort()` also gains a `parent` argument. This is meant for situations where you're calling a low level API (to download a file, parse a JSON file, etc) and would like to intercept errors with `base::tryCatch()` or `rlang::with_handlers()` and rethrow them with a high-level message. Call `abort()` with the intercepted error as the `parent` argument. When the user prints `rlang::last_error()`, the backtrace will be shown in two sections corresponding to the high-level and low-level contexts. In order to get segmented backtraces, the low-level error has to be thrown with `abort()`. When that's not the case, you can call the low-level function within `with_abort()` to automatically promote all errors to rlang errors."
rlang,340,d776ceef343a065edda37f438842b0f7,The tidy eval changes are mostly for developers of data masking APIs. The main user-facing change is that `.data[[` is now an unquote operator so that `var` in `.data[[var]]` is never masked by data frame columns and always picked from the environment. This makes the pronoun safe for programming in functions.
rlang,341,ae6baef66502b64285035c070522be75,"The `!!!` operator now supports all classed objects like factors. It calls `as.list()` on S3 objects and `as(x, ""list"")` on S4 objects."

These backtraces are now recorded in errors thrown by `abort()` (see below)."
rlang,344,b80c6699addc34bb17f643e5aec02a66,`abort()` gains a `parent` argument to specify a parent error. This is meant for situations where a low-level error is expected (e.g. download or parsing failed) and you'd like to throw an error with higher level information. Specifying the low-level error as parent makes it possible to partition the backtraces based on ancestry.
rlang,345,824370267c5e7d712f4b5aac643d2482,Errors thrown with `abort()` now embed a backtrace in the condition object. It is no longer necessary to record a trace with a calling handler for such errors.
rlang,346,bee596a1335bb869579ccba0b154282e,`with_abort()` runs expressions in a context where all errors are promoted to rlang errors and gain a backtrace.
