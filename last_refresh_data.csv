ggplot2,1,"ggplot2 now supports/uses tidy evaluation (as described below). This is a major change and breaks a number of packages; we made this breaking change because it is important to make ggplot2 more programmable, and to be more consistent with the rest of the tidyverse. The best general (and detailed) introduction to tidy evaluation can be found in the meta programming chapters in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz). The primary developer facing change is that `aes()` now contains quosures (expression + environment pairs) rather than symbols, and you'll need to take a different approach to extracting the information you need. A common symptom of this change are errors ""undefined columns selected"" or ""invalid 'type' (list) of argument"" (#2610). As in the previous version, constants (like `aes(x = 1)` or `aes(colour = ""smoothed"")`) are stored as is. In this version of ggplot2, if you need to describe a mapping in a string, use `quo_name()` (to generate single-line strings; longer expressions may be abbreviated) or `quo_text()` (to generate non-abbreviated strings that may span multiple lines). If you do need to extract the value of a variable instead use `rlang::eval_tidy()`. You may want to condition on `(packageVersion(""ggplot2"") <= ""2.2.1"")` so that your code can work with both released and development versions of ggplot2. We recognise that this is a big change and if you're not already familiar with rlang, there's a lot to learn.

The first two arguments of `facet_grid()` become `rows` and `cols` and now support `vars()` inputs. Note however that we took special care to ensure complete backward compatibility. With this change `facet_grid(vars(cyl), vars(am, vs))` is equivalent to `facet_grid(cyl ~ am + vs)`, and `facet_grid(cols = vars(am, vs))` is equivalent to `facet_grid(. ~ am + vs)`.

Previously `dplyr::join(by = .data$foo)` would silently be interpreted as `dplyr::join(by = NULL)`. This is now an error. Another issue is using `.data` inside `ggplot2::labs(...)`.

We've added the function `is_call_simple()` to make it easier to work safely with `call_name()`. The invariant is that `call_name()` always returns a string when `is_call_simple()` returns `TRUE`.

rlang,1,`enquos()` is a variant of `quos()` that has a more natural interface for capturing multiple arguments and `...`.,NA
rlang,1,"The backend for `quos()`, `exprs()`, `list2()`, `dots_list()`, etc is now written in C. This greatly improve the performance of dots capture, especially with the splicing operator `!!!` which now scales much better (you'll see a 1000x performance gain in some cases). The unquoting algorithm has also been improved which makes `enexpr()` and `enquo()` more efficient as well.",NA
rlang,1,"The tidy eval `!!` operator now binds tightly. You no longer have to wrap it in parentheses, i.e. `!!x > y` will only unquote `x`. Technically the `!!` operator has the same precedence as unary `-` and `+`. This means that `!!a:b` and `!!a + b` are equivalent to `(!!a):b` and `(!!a) + b`. On the other hand `!!a^b` and `!!a$b` are equivalent to`!!(a^b)` and `!!(a$b)`.",NA
rlang,1,"The print method for quosures has been greatly improved. Quosures no longer appear as formulas but as expressions prefixed with `^`; quosures are colourised according to their environment; unquoted objects are displayed between angular brackets instead of code (i.e. an unquoted integer vector is shown as `<int: 1, 2>` rather than `1:2`); unquoted S3 objects are displayed using `pillar::type_sum()` if available.",NA
rlang,1,"New `enquos()` function to capture arguments. It treats `...` the same way as `quos()` but can also capture named arguments just like `enquo()`, i.e. one level up. By comparison `quos(arg)` only captures the name `arg` rather than the expression supplied to the `arg` argument. In addition, `enexprs()` is like `enquos()` but like `exprs()` it returns bare expressions. And `ensyms()` expects strings or symbols.",NA

rlang,1,`quo_expr()` has been renamed to `quo_squash()` in order to better reflect that it is a lossy operation that flattens all nested quosures.,NA
rlang,1,`!!!` now accepts any kind of objects for consistency. Scalar types are treated as vectors of length 1. Previously only symbolic objects like symbols and calls were treated as such.,NA
rlang,1,`ensym()` is a new variant of `enexpr()` that expects a symbol or a string and always returns a symbol. If a complex expression is supplied it fails with an error.,NA
rlang,1,`exprs()` and `quos()` gain a `.unquote_names` arguments to switch off interpretation of `:=` as a name operator. This should be useful for programming on the language targetting APIs such as data.table.,NA
rlang,1,`exprs()` gains a `.named` option to auto-label its arguments (#267).,NA
rlang,1,"Functions taking dots by value rather than by expression (e.g. regular functions, not quoting functions) have a more restricted set of unquoting operations.

rlang,1,Functions taking dots with `list2()` or `dots_list()` now support splicing of `NULL` values. `!!! NULL` is equivalent to `!!! list()` (#242).,NA
rlang,1,"Capture operators now support evaluated arguments. Capturing a forced or evaluated argument is exactly the same as unquoting that argument: the actual object (even if a vector) is inlined in the expression. Capturing a forced argument occurs when you use `enquo()`, `enexpr()`, etc too late.

rlang,1,"Parentheses around `!!` are automatically removed. This makes the generated expression call cleaner: `(!! sym(""name""))(arg)`.

rlang,1,"We now use the term ""data mask"" instead of ""overscope"". We think data mask is a more natural name in the context of R. We say that that objects from user data mask objects in the current environment. This makes reference to object masking in the search path which is due to the same mechanism (in technical terms, lexical scoping with hierarchically nested environments). Following this new terminology, the new functions `as_data_mask()` and `new_data_mask()` replace `as_overscope()` and `new_overscope()`. `as_data_mask()` has also a more consistent interface.

rlang,1,"`!!` now binds tightly in order to match intuitive parsing of tidy eval code, e.g. `!! x > y` is now equivalent to `(!! x) > y`.

rlang,1,`is_node()` now returns `TRUE` for calls as well and `is_pairlist()` does not return `TRUE` for `NULL` objects. Use `is_node_list()` to determine whether an object either of type `pairlist` or `NULL`. Note that all these functions are still experimental.,NA
rlang,1,`set_names()` no longer automatically splices lists of character vectors as we are moving away from automatic splicing semantics.,NA
rlang,1,Calling the functional forms of unquote operators with the rlang namespace qualifier is soft-deprecated. `UQ()` and `UQS()` are not function calls so it does not make sense to namespace them. Supporting namespace qualifiers complicates the implementation of unquotation and is misleading as to the nature of unquoting (which are syntactic operators at quotation-time rather than function calls at evaluation-time).,NA
rlang,1,"We are now questioning `UQ()` and `UQS()` as functional forms of `!!`. If `!!` and `!!!` were native R operators, they would parse to the functional calls `` `!!`() `` and `` `!!!`() ``. This is now the preferred way to unquote with a function call rather than with the operators. We haven't decided yet whether we will deprecate `UQ()` and `UQS()` in the future. In any case we recommend using the new functional forms.",NA
rlang,1,`parse_quosure()` and `parse_quosures()` are soft-deprecated in favour of `parse_quo()` and `parse_quos()`. These new names are consistent with the rule that abbreviated suffixes indicate the return type of a function. In addition the new functions require their callers to explicitly supply an environment for the quosures.,NA
rlang,1,Using `f_rhs()` and `f_env()` on quosures is soft-deprecated. The fact that quosures are formulas is an implementation detail that might change in the future. Please use `quo_get_expr()` and `quo_get_env()` instead.,NA

rlang,1,"`lgl_len()`, `int_len()` etc have been soft-deprecated and renamed with `new_` prefix, e.g. `new_logical()` and `new_integer()`. This is for consistency with other non-variadic object constructors.",NA
rlang,1,`ll()` is now an alias to `list2()`. This is consistent with the new `call2()` constructor for calls. `list2()` and `call2()` are versions of `list()` and `call()` that support splicing of lists with `!!!`. `ll()` remains around as a shorthand for users who like its conciseness.,NA
