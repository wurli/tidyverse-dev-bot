broom,NA,1,2,Improves performance of `tidy.lm()` and `tidy.glm()` for full-rank fits (#1112 by `@capnrefsmmat`).
broom,NA,1,3,"Moves forward with deprecation of tidiers for sparse matrices outputted from the Matrix package, initially soft-deprecated in broom 0.5.0. The Matrix tidiers were light wrappers around coercion methods that will now be deprecated from Matrix itself in the upcoming 1.4-2 release. The affected methods are `tidy.sparseMatrix()`, `tidy.dgCMatrix()`, and `tidy.dgTMatrix()`. Note that `tidy.confusionMatrix()`, for relevant objects outputted from the caret package, is unaffected (#1113)."
broom,NA,1,4,`tidy.anova()` works again with `anova` objects from the `lme4` package (broken by addition of the `terms` column in the previous release)
broom,NA,1,8,Adds minimal ellipsis checking to warn on commonly misspecified arguments passed through ellipses. Notably:
broom,8,2,9,`tidy()` methods will now warn when supplied an `exponentiate` argument if it will be ignored.
broom,8,2,10,`augment()` methods will now warn when supplied a `newdata` argument if it will be ignored.
broom,NA,1,11,"The warning regarding tidiers only maintained via dispatch to `lm` and `glm` is now displayed only once per session, per unique dispatch. That is, if a `class_a` object is tidied using a `(g)lm` method, broom will not warn when tidying `class_a` objects for the rest of the session, but if a `class_b` object is tidied using a `(g)lm` method in the same session, broom will warn again (#1101)."
broom,NA,1,13,Add `exponentiate` argument to `tidy.boot()` (#1039).
broom,NA,1,14,Update in `tidy.htest()` converting matrix-columns to vector-columns (#1081).
broom,NA,1,15,Address failures in `tidy.glht()` with `conf.int = TRUE` (#1103).
broom,NA,1,16,Address failures in `tidy.zoo()` when input data does not have `colnames` (#1080).
broom,NA,1,17,Transition tidiers for bivariate linear or spline-based interpolation---using list tidiers to interface with objects from the akima package is now considered off-label. See the interp package for a FOSS alternative.
broom,NA,1,18,"Address failures in `tidy.svyolr()` when `p.values = TRUE`. Instead of aliasing `tidy.polr()` directly, `tidy.svyolr()` lightly wraps that method and warns if `p.values` is supplied (#1107)."
broom,NA,1,19,Adds a `term` column and introduces support for `car::lht()` output in `tidy.anova()` (#1106 by `@grantmcdermott`).
broom,NA,1,20,"Adds a dedicated `glance.anova` method (which previously dispatched to the\ deprecated `glance.data.frame()` tidier, #1106 by `@grantmcdermott`)."
broom,NA,1,23,Makes many improvements to documentation:
broom,23,2,24,All tidiers now have example code demonstrating usage in their documentation. Tidiers for base packages as well as selected others also include sample code for visualization of results with ggplot2.
broom,23,2,25,"Code examples in the documentation largely now follow consistent style---these changes were made largely to reflect the tidyverse style guide, addressing spacing, object naming, and commenting, among other things."
broom,23,2,26,Examples previously marked with `\dontrun` or `\donttest` have been workshopped to run reliably.
broom,NA,1,27,Clarifies errors and warnings for deprecated and unmaintained tidiers.
broom,NA,1,28,Ensures that tidiers are placed in files named according to the model-supplying package rather than the model object class for easier navigability of the source code.
broom,NA,1,29,"Fix `glance.fixest` error when model includes only fixed effects and no regressors (`#1018` by `@arcruz0`, `#1088` by `@vincentarelbundock`)."
broom,NA,1,30,"Address excessive messaging from `tidy.speedlm` (`#1084` by `@cgoo4`, `#1087` by `@vincentarelbundock`)."
broom,NA,1,31,"Add `nobs` column to the output of `glance.svyglm` (`#1085` by `@fschaffner`, `#1086` by `@vincentarelbundock`)."
broom,NA,1,32,Ensure `tidy.prcomp` description entries use consistent punctuation (`#1072` by `@PursuitOfDataScience`).
broom,NA,1,33,Address breaking changes in `glance.fixest` and `tidy.btergm`.
broom,NA,1,34,Simplify handling of `MASS::polr` output in the corresponding `tidy` and `augment` methods.
broom,NA,1,35,Align continuous integration with current standards in tidymodels packages.
broom,NA,1,37,Addressed issue with the ordering of original observations in `augment.rqs`. Now function preserves the original `data.frame` names also when the input `data.frame` only has one column (`#1052` by `@ilapros`).
broom,NA,1,38,Addressed warning from `tidy.rma` when `x$ddf` has length greater than 1 (`#1064` by `@wviechtb`).
broom,NA,1,39,Fix errors in `glance.lavaan` in anticipation of upcoming `tidyr` release (`#1067` by `@DavisVaughan`).
broom,NA,1,40,Corrected the confidence interval in `tidy.crr()`. The `tidy.crr(conf.level=)` argument was previously ignored (`#1068` by `@ddsjoberg`).
broom,NA,1,41,Clarifies error when `pysch::mediate` output is dispatched to `tidy.mediate` (`#1037` by `@LukasWallrich`).
broom,NA,1,42,Allows user to specify confidence level for `tidy.rma` (`#1041` by `@TarenSanders`)
broom,NA,1,43,Clarifies documentation related to usage of `augment_columns()`; most package users should use `augment()` in favor of `augment_columns()`. See `?augment_columns` for more details.
broom,NA,1,44,Extends support for `emmeans` by fixing non-standard column names in case of asymptotically derived inferential statistics. (`#1046` by `@crsh`)
broom,NA,1,45,"Fixes use of index columns in `augment.mlogit` and adds `.resid` column to output. (`#1045`, `#1053`, `#1055`, and `#1056` by `@jamesrrae` and `@gregmacfarlane`)"

broom,NA,1,47,Various bug fixes and improvements to documentation.
broom,NA,1,48,"Fixes confidence intervals in `tidy.crr()`, which were previously exponentiated when `exponentiate = FALSE` (`#1023` by `@leejasme`)"
broom,NA,1,49,"Deprecates `Rchoice` tidiers, as the newest 0.3-3 release requires R 4.0+ and does not re-export needed generics."

broom,NA,1,51,Fixed bug in `glance.ergm` related to handling of MCMC details.
broom,NA,1,52,Address breakages in unit tests for {fixest} tidiers.

broom,NA,1,97,`glance.survfit()` now passes `...` to `summary.survfit()` to allow for adjustment of RMST and other measures (`#880` by `@vincentarelbundock`)
broom,NA,1,98,Several unsupported model objects that subclass `glm` and `lm` now error more informatively.
broom,NA,1,99,A number of improvements to documentation throughout the package.
broom,NA,1,100,Fixed `newdata` warning message in `augment.*()` output when the `newdata` didn't contain the response variable---augment methods no longer expect the response variable in the supplied `newdata` argument. (`#897` by `@rudeboybert`)
broom,NA,1,101,Fixed a bug related to `tidy.geeglm()` not being sensitive to the `exponentiate` argument (`#867`)
broom,NA,1,102,Fixed `augment.fixest()` returning residuals in the `.fitted` column. The method also now takes a `type.residuals` argument and defaults to the same `type.predict` argument as the `fixest` `predict()` method. (`#877` by `@karldw`)
broom,NA,1,103,"Fix `tidy.felm` confidence interval bug. Replaces ""robust"" argument with ""se.type"". (`#919` by `@grantmcdermott`; supersedes `#818` by `@kuriwaki`)"
broom,NA,1,104,Fix a bug in `tidy.drc()` where some term labels would result in the overwriting of entries in the `curve` column (`#914`)
broom,NA,1,105,Fixed bug related to univariate zoo series in `tidy.zoo()` (`#916` by `@WillemVervoort`)
broom,NA,1,106,"Fixed a bug related to `tidy.prcomp()` assigning the wrong PC labels from ""loadings"" and ""scores"" matrices (`#910` by `@tavareshugo`)"
broom,NA,1,107,Fixed `tidy.polr()` bug where p-values could only be returned if `exponentiate = FALSE`.
broom,NA,1,110,"We have changed how we report degrees of freedom for `lm` objects (#212, #273). This is especially important for instructors in statistics courses. Previously the `df` column in `glance.lm()` reported the rank of the design matrix. Now it reports degrees of freedom of the numerator for the overall F-statistic. This is equal to the rank of the model matrix minus one (unless you omit an intercept column), so the new `df` should be the old `df` minus one."
broom,NA,1,111,"We are moving away from supporting `summary.*()` objects. In particular, we have removed `tidy.summary.lm()` as part of a major overhaul of internals. Instead of calling `tidy()` on `summary`-like objects, please call `tidy()` directly on model objects moving forward."
broom,NA,1,112,"We have removed all support for the `quick` argument in `tidy()` methods. This is to simplify internals and is for maintainability purposes. We anticipate this will not influence many users as few people seemed to use it. If this majorly cramps your style, let us know, as we are considering a new verb to return only model parameters. In the meantime, `stats::coef()` together with `tibble::enframe()` provides most of the functionality of `tidy(..., quick = TRUE)`."
broom,NA,1,113,"All `conf.int` arguments now default to `FALSE`, and all `conf.level` arguments now default to `0.95`. This should primarily affect `tidy.survreg()`, which previously always returned confidence intervals, although there are some others."
broom,NA,1,114,"Tidiers for `emmeans`-objects use the arguments `conf.int` and `conf.level` instead of relying on the argument names native to the `emmeans::summary()`-methods (i.e., `infer` and `level`). Similarly, `multcomp`-tidiers now include a call to `summary()` as previous behavior was akin to setting the now removed argument `quick = TRUE`. Both families of tidiers now use the `adj.p.value` column name when appropriate. Finally, `emmeans`-, `multcomp`-, and `TukeyHSD`-tidiers now consistently use the column names `contrast` and `null.value` instead of `comparison`, `level1` and `level2`, or `lhs` and `rhs` (see #692)."

broom,NA,1,131,"We have renamed the output of `augment.htest()`. In particular, we have renamed the `.residuals` column to `.resid` and the `.stdres` to `.std.resid` for consistency. These changes will only affect chi-squared tests."
broom,NA,1,132,`tidy.ridgelm()` now always return a `GCV` column and never returns an `xm` column. (#533 by @jmuhlenkamp)
broom,NA,1,133,`tidy.dist()` no longer supports the `upper` argument.
broom,NA,1,135,"If you pass a dataset to `augment()` via the `data` or `newdata` arguments, you are now guaranteed that the augmented dataset will have exactly the same number of rows as the original dataset. This differs from previous behavior primarily when there are missing values. Previously `augment()` would drop rows containing `NA`. This should no longer be the case."
broom,NA,1,136,`augment.*()` methods no longer accept an `na.action` argument.
broom,NA,1,137,"In previous versions, several `augment.*()` methods inherited the `augment.lm()` method, but required additions to the `augment.lm()` method itself. We have shifted away from this approach in favor of re-implementing many `augment.*()` methods as standalone methods making use of internal helper functions. As a result, `augment.lm()` and some related methods have deprecated (previously unused) arguments."
broom,NA,1,138,`augment()` tries to give an informative error when `data` isn't the original training data.

cli,NA,1,13,cli exit handlers are now compatible again with the withr package (#437).
cli,NA,1,14,cli functions now keep trailing `\f` characters as newlines. They also keep multiple consecutive `\f` as multiple newlinees (#491).

cli,NA,1,16,"cli now replaces newline characters within `{.class ... }` inline styles with spaces. If the `cli.warn_inline_newlines` option is set to TRUE, then it also throws a warning. (#417)."
cli,NA,1,17,"`code_highlight` now falls back to the default theme (instead of no theme) for unknown RStudio themes (#482, @rossellhayes)."
cli,NA,1,18,`cli_abort()` now supplies `.frame` to `abort()`. This fixes an issue with the `.internal = TRUE` argument (r-lib/rlang#1386).
cli,NA,1,19,"cli now does a better job at detecting the RStudio build pane, job pane and render pane, and their capabilities w.r.t. ANSI colors and hyperlinks. Note that this requires a daily build of RStudio (#465)."
cli,NA,1,20,"New functions for ANSI strings: `ansi_grep()`, `ansi_grepl()`, `ansi_nzchar()`. They work like the corresponding base R functions, but handle ANSI markup."

cli,NA,1,30,"The preferred names of the S3 classes `ansi_string`, `ansi_style`, `boxx`, `rule` and `tree` now have `cli_` prefix: `cli_ansi_string`, etc. This will help avoiding name conflicts with other packages eventually, but for now the old names are kept as well, for compatibility."
cli,NA,1,31,`cli_abort()` has been updated to work nicely with rlang 1.0. The default `call` and backtrace soft-truncation are set to `.envir` (which itself is set to the immediate caller of `cli_abort()` by default).

cli,39,2,41,they handle `NA` values better.
cli,39,2,42,"many functions now use UTF-8 graphemes by default instead of code points. E.g. `ansi_nchar()` counts graphemes, etc."

dbplyr,NA,1,322,"You can now use the magrittr pipe within expressions, e.g. `mutate(mtcars, cyl %>% as.character())`."
dbplyr,NA,1,323,"If a translation was supplied for a summarise function, but not for the equivalent windowed variant, the expression would be translated to `NULL` with a warning. Now `sql_variant()` checks that all aggregate functions have matching window functions so that correct translations or clean errors will be generated (#2887)"
dbplyr,NA,1,324,"`tbl()` and `copy_to()` now work directly with DBI connections (#2423, #2576), so there is no longer a need to generate a dplyr src."
dbplyr,NA,1,325,`glimpse()` now works with remote tables (#2665)
dbplyr,NA,1,326,"dplyr has gained a basic SQL optimiser, which collapses certain nested SELECT queries into a single query (#1979). This will improve query execution performance for databases with less sophisticated query optimisers, and fixes certain problems with ordering and limits in subqueries (#1979). A big thanks goes to @hhoeflin for figuring out this optimisation."
dbplyr,NA,1,327,"`compute()` and `collapse()` now preserve the ""ordering"" of rows. This only affects the computation of window functions, as the rest of SQL does not care about row order (#2281)."

dbplyr,NA,1,330,`query()` is no longer exported. It hasn't been useful for a while so this shouldn't break any code.
dbplyr,NA,1,331,Partial evaluation occurs immediately when you execute a verb (like `filter()` or `mutate()`) rather than happening when the query is executed (#2370).
dbplyr,NA,1,332,"`mutate.tbl_sql()` will now generate as many subqueries as necessary so that you can refer to variables that you just created (like in mutate with regular dataframes) (#2481, #2483)."
dbplyr,NA,1,333,SQL joins have been improved:
dbplyr,333,2,334,"SQL joins always use the `ON ...` syntax, avoiding `USING ...` even for natural joins. Improved handling of tables with columns of the same name (#1997, @javierluraschi). They now generate SQL more similar to what you'd write by hand, eliminating a layer or two of subqueries (#2333)"
dbplyr,333,2,335,"\[API\] They now follow the same rules for including duplicated key variables that the data frame methods do, namely that key variables are only kept from `x`, and never from `y` (#2410)"
dbplyr,333,2,336,"\[API\] The `sql_join()` generic now gains a `vars` argument which lists the variables taken from the left and right sides of the join. If you have a custom `sql_join()` method, you'll need to update how your code generates joins, following the template in `sql_join.generic()`."

dbplyr,NA,1,358,`is.na()` and `is.null()` gain extra parens in SQL translation to preserve correct precedence (#2302).
dbplyr,NA,1,359,"\[API\] `log(x, b)` is now correctly translated to the SQL `log(b, x)` (#2288). SQLite does not support the 2-argument log function so it is translated to `log(x) / log(b)`."

dbplyr,NA,1,361,`n_distinct()` now accepts multiple variables (#2148).
dbplyr,NA,1,362,"\[API\] `substr()` is now translated to SQL, correcting for the difference in the third argument. In R, it's the position of the last character, in SQL it's the length of the string (#2536)."
dbplyr,NA,1,363,`win_over()` escapes expression using current database rules.
dbplyr,NA,1,364,`copy_to()` now uses `db_write_table()` instead of `db_create_table()` and `db_insert_into()`. `db_write_table.DBIConnection()` uses `dbWriteTable()`.
dbplyr,NA,1,365,"New `db_copy_to()`, `db_compute()` and `db_collect()` allow backends to override the entire database process behind `copy_to()`, `compute()` and `collect()`. `db_sql_render()` allow additional control over the SQL rendering process."

dbplyr,NA,1,372,SQL translation for Apache Impala (@edgararuiz)
dbplyr,NA,1,373,`collect()` once again defaults to return all rows in the data (#1968). This makes it behave the same as `as.data.frame()` and `as_tibble()`.
dbplyr,NA,1,374,`collect()` only regroups by variables present in the data (#2156)
dbplyr,NA,1,375,"`collect()` will automatically LIMIT the result to the `n`, the number of rows requested. This will provide the query planner with more information that it may be able to use to improve execution time (#2083)."
dbplyr,NA,1,376,`common_by()` gets a better error message for unexpected inputs (#2091)
dbplyr,NA,1,377,"`copy_to()` no longer checks that the table doesn't exist before creation, instead preferring to fall back on the database for error messages. This should reduce both false positives and false negative (#1470)"
dbplyr,NA,1,378,"`copy_to()` now succeeds for MySQL if a character column contains `NA` (#1975, #2256, #2263, #2381, @demorenoc, @eduardgrebe)."
dbplyr,NA,1,379,`copy_to()` now returns it's output invisibly (since you're often just calling for the side-effect).
dbplyr,NA,1,380,`distinct()` reports improved variable information for SQL backends. This means that it is more likely to work in the middle of a pipeline (#2359).
dbplyr,NA,1,381,Ungrouped `do()` on database backends now collects all data locally first (#2392).
dbplyr,NA,1,382,Call `dbFetch()` instead of the deprecated `fetch()` (#2134). Use `DBI::dbExecute()` for non-query SQL commands (#1912)
dbplyr,NA,1,383,"`explain()` and `show_query()` now invisibly return the first argument, making them easier to use inside a pipeline."
dbplyr,NA,1,384,"`print.tbl_sql()` displays ordering (#2287) and prints table name, if known."
dbplyr,NA,1,385,"`print(df, n = Inf)` and `head(df, n = Inf)` now work with remote tables (#2580)."
dbplyr,NA,1,386,`db_desc()` and `sql_translate_env()` get defaults for DBIConnection.
dbplyr,NA,1,387,"Formatting now works by overriding the `tbl_sum()` generic instead of `print()`. This means that the output is more consistent with tibble, and that `format()` is now supported also for SQL sources (tidyverse/dbplyr#14)."
dbplyr,NA,1,388,"\[API\] The signature of `op_base` has changed to `op_base(x, vars, class)`"
dbplyr,NA,1,389,\[API\] `translate_sql()` and `partial_eval()` have been refined:
dbplyr,389,2,390,`translate_sql()` no longer takes a vars argument; instead call `partial_eval()` yourself.
dbplyr,389,2,391,"Because it no longer needs the environment `translate_sql()_` now works with a list of dots, rather than a `lazy_dots`."
dbplyr,389,2,392,`partial_eval()` now takes a character vector of variable names rather than a tbl.
dbplyr,389,2,393,This leads to a simplification of the `op` data structure: dots is now a list of expressions rather than a `lazy_dots`.
dbplyr,NA,1,394,\[API\] `op_vars()` now returns a list of quoted expressions. This enables escaping to happen at the correct time (i.e. when the connection is known).
dplyr,NA,1,1,Using 1 column matrices in `filter()` is now deprecated (#6091).
dplyr,NA,1,2,Warnings emitted inside `mutate()` and variants are now collected and stashed away. Run the new `last_dplyr_warnings()` function to see the warnings emitted within dplyr verbs during the last top-level command.
dplyr,NA,1,3,"This fixes performance issues when thousands of warnings are emitted with rowwise and grouped data frames (#6005, #6236)."
dplyr,NA,1,4,`group_by_prepare()` loses the `caller_env` argument. It was rarely used and it is no longer needed (#6444).
dplyr,NA,1,5,"`nth()`, `first()`, `last()`, and `with_order()` now sort character `order_by` vectors in the C locale. Using character vectors for `order_by` is rare, so we expect this to have little practical impact (#6451)."
dplyr,NA,1,6,`slice()`ing with a 1-column matrix is now deprecated.
dplyr,NA,1,7,"`row_number()`, `min_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `ntile()`, `cume_dist()`, and `percent_rank()` are now powered by vctrs, meaning that they are faster and work for more types. You can now also rank by multiple columns at once by supplying a data frame to these functions (#6428)."
dplyr,NA,1,8,`ntile()` now requires `n` to be a single positive integer.
dplyr,NA,1,9,"`transmute()` is superseded in favour of `mutate(.keep = ""none"")`"

dplyr,NA,1,25,`slice_*()` generics now perform argument validation. This should make methods more consistent and simpler to implement (#6361).
dplyr,NA,1,26,New `symdiff()` function computes the symmetric difference (#4811).
dplyr,NA,1,27,`slice_min()` and `slice_max()` can `order_by` multiple variables if you supply them as a data.frame or tibble (#6176).
dplyr,NA,1,28,"`slice_min()` and `slice_max()` now consistently include missing values in the result if necessary (i.e. there aren't enough non-missing values to reach the `n` or `prop` you have selected). If you don't want missing values to be included at all, set `na_rm = TRUE` (#6177)."
dplyr,NA,1,29,`relocate()` now works correctly with empty data frames and when `.before` or `.after` result in empty selections (#6167).
dplyr,NA,1,30,`relocate()` no longer drops attributes of bare data frames (#6341).

dplyr,NA,1,47,"`slice_sample()` returns a data frame or group with the same number of rows as the input when `replace = FALSE` and `n` is larger than the number of rows or `prop` is larger than 1. This reverts a change made in 1.0.8, returning to the behavior of 1.0.7 (#6185)"
dplyr,NA,1,48,"`slice()` helpers again produce output equivalent to `slice(.data, 0)` when the `n` or `prop` argument is 0, fixing a bug introduced in the previous version (@eutwt, #6184)."

dplyr,NA,1,50,`distinct()` now retains attributes of bare data frames (#6318).
dplyr,NA,1,51,"dplyr no longer provides `count()` and `tally()` methods for `tbl_sql`. These methods have been accidentally overriding the `tbl_lazy` methods that dbplyr provides, which has resulted in issues with the grouping structure of the output (#6338, tidyverse/dbplyr#940)."
dplyr,NA,1,52,"`relocate()` now retains the last name change when a single column is renamed multiple times while it is being moved. This better matches the behavior of `rename()` (#6209, with help from @eutwt)."
dplyr,NA,1,53,`na_if()` has been rewritten to utilize vctrs. This comes with the following improvements (#6329):
dplyr,53,2,54,"It now casts `y` to the type of `x` before comparing them, which makes it clearer that this function is type and size stable on `x`. In particular, this means that you can no longer do `na_if(<tibble>, 0)`, which previously accidentally allowed you to replace any instance of `0` across every column of the tibble with `NA`. `na_if()` was never intended to work this way, and this is considered off-label usage."
dplyr,53,2,55,"You can now replace `NaN` values in `x` with `NA` through `na_if(x, NaN)`."
dplyr,NA,1,56,"`first()`, `last()`, and `nth()` have been rewritten to use vctrs. This comes with the following improvements (#6331):"
dplyr,56,2,57,"When used on a data frame, these functions now return a single row rather than a single column. This is more consistent with the vctrs principle that a data frame is generally treated as a vector of rows."
dplyr,56,2,58,"The `default` is no longer ""guessed"", and will always automatically be set to a missing value appropriate for the type of `x`."
dplyr,56,2,59,"Fractional values of `n` are no longer truncated to integers, and will now cause an error. For example, `nth(x, n = 2)` is fine, but `nth(x, n = 2.5)` is now an error."
dplyr,NA,1,60,"`lag()` and `lead()` now cast `default` to the type of `x`, rather than taking the common type. This ensures that these functions are type stable on `x` (#6330)."
dplyr,NA,1,61,`with_order()` now checks that the size of `order_by` is the same size as `x`.
dplyr,NA,1,62,`with_order()` now works correctly when data frames are used as the `order_by` value (#6334).
dplyr,NA,1,63,`coalesce()` now more fully embraces the principles of vctrs (#6265).
dplyr,63,2,64,`.ptype` and `.size` arguments have been added to allow you to explicitly enforce an output type and size.
dplyr,63,2,65,`NULL` inputs are now discarded up front.
dplyr,63,2,66,"`coalesce()` no longer iterates over the columns of data frame input. Instead, a row is now only coalesced if it is entirely missing, which is consistent with `vctrs::vec_equal_na()` and greatly simplifies the implementation."
dplyr,NA,1,67,"`group_by()` now uses a new algorithm for computing groups. It is often faster than the previous approach (especially when there are many groups), and in most cases there should be no changes. The one exception is with character vectors, see the C locale news bullet below for more details (#4406, #6297)."
dplyr,NA,1,68,"`arrange()` now uses a faster algorithm for sorting character vectors, which is heavily inspired by data.table's `forder()`. See the C locale news bullet below for more details (#4962)."
dplyr,NA,1,69,"`arrange()` and `group_by()` now both default to using the C locale when ordering or grouping character vectors rather than the system locale. This brings *substantial* performance improvements, increases reproducibility across R sessions, makes dplyr more consistent with data.table, and we believe it should affect little existing code. If it does affect your code, you can use `options(dplyr.legacy_locale = TRUE)` to quickly revert to the previous behavior. In general, we instead recommend that you use the new `.locale` argument of `arrange()` when the locale matters. For a full explanation of this change, please read the associated [grouping](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyups/blob/main/006-dplyr-group-by-ordering.md) and [ordering](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyups/blob/main/003-dplyr-radix-ordering.md) tidyups."
dplyr,NA,1,70,"`if_else()` has been rewritten to utilize vctrs. This comes with most of the same benefits as the `case_when()` rewrite. In particular, `if_else()` now takes the common type of `true`, `false`, and `missing` when determining what the output type should be, meaning that you no longer have to be quite as strict about types when supplying values for them (for example, you no longer need to supply typed `NA` values, like `NA_character_`) (#6243)."
dplyr,NA,1,71,`case_when()` has been rewritten to utilize vctrs (#5106). This comes with a number of useful improvements:
dplyr,71,2,72,"There is a new `.default` argument that is intended to replace usage of `TRUE ~ default_value` as a more explicit and readable way to specify a default value. In the future, we will deprecate the unsafe recycling of the LHS inputs that allows `TRUE ~` to work, so we encourage you to switch over to using `.default` instead."
dplyr,71,2,73,"The types of the RHS inputs no longer have to match exactly. For example, the following no longer requires you to use `NA_character_` instead of just `NA`."
dplyr,71,2,74,"`case_when()` now supports a larger variety of value types. For example, you can use a data frame to create multiple columns at once."
dplyr,71,2,75,There are new `.ptype` and `.size` arguments which allow you to enforce a particular output type and size. This allows you to construct a completely type and size stable call to `case_when()`.
dplyr,71,2,76,"The error thrown when types or lengths were incorrect has been improved (#6261, #6206)."
dplyr,NA,1,77,`tbl_sum()` is no longer reexported from tibble (#6284).
dplyr,NA,1,78,`slice_sample()` now gives a more informative error when `replace = FALSE` and the number of rows requested in the sample exceeds the number of rows in the data (#6271).
dplyr,NA,1,79,`frame_data()` is no longer reexported from tibble (#6278).
dplyr,NA,1,80,`lst_()` is no longer reexported from tibble (#6276).
dplyr,NA,1,81,`data_frame_()` is no longer reexported from tibble (#6277).
dplyr,NA,1,82,"`between()` has been rewritten to utilize vctrs. This means that it is no longer restricted to just numeric and date-time vectors. Additionally, `left` and `right` are no longer required to be scalars, they can now also be vectors with the same length as `x`. Finally, `left` and `right` are now cast to the type of `x` before the comparison is made. This last change means that you can no longer make comparisons like `between(<int>, 0, 2.5)`, as `2.5` can't be cast to integer without losing information. We recommend that you convert the `<int>` vector to double before calling `between()` if you require this (#6183, #6260)."
dplyr,NA,1,83,"Joins have undergone a complete overhaul. The purpose of this overhaul is to enable more flexible join operations, while also providing tools to perform quality control checks directly in the join call. Many of these changes are inspired by data.table's join syntax (#5914, #5661, #5413, #2240)."
dplyr,83,2,84,"A *join specification* can now be created through `join_by()`. This allows you to specify both the left and right hand side of a join using unquoted column names, such as `join_by(sale_date == commercial_date)`. Join specifications can be supplied to any `*_join()` function as the `by` argument."
dplyr,83,2,85,Join specifications allow for various new types of joins:
dplyr,85,3,86,"Equi joins: The most common join, specified by `==`. For example, `join_by(sale_date == commercial_date)`."
dplyr,85,3,87,"Non-equi joins: For joining on conditions other than equality, specified by `>=`, `>`, `<`, and `<=`. For example, `join_by(sale_date >= commercial_date)` to find every commercial that aired before a particular sale."
dplyr,85,3,88,"Rolling joins: For ""rolling"" the closest match forward or backwards when there isn't an exact match, specified by using the rolling helper, `closest()`. For example, `join_by(closest(sale_date >= commercial_date))` to find only the most recent commercial that aired before a particular sale."
dplyr,85,3,89,"Overlap joins: For detecting overlaps between sets of columns, specified by using one of the overlap helpers: `between()`, `within()`, or `overlaps()`. For example, `join_by(between(commercial_date, sale_date_lower, sale_date))` to find commercials that aired before a particular sale, as long as they occurred after some lower bound, such as 40 days before the sale was made."
dplyr,83,2,90,"Note that you cannot use arbitrary expressions in the join conditions, like `join_by(sale_date - 40 >= commercial_date)`. Instead, use `mutate()` to create a new column containing the result of `sale_date - 40` and refer to that by name in `join_by()`."
dplyr,83,2,91,"`multiple` is a new argument for controlling what happens when a row in `x` matches multiple rows in `y`. For equi joins and rolling joins, where this is usually surprising, this defaults to signaling a `""warning""`, but still returns all of the matches. For non-equi joins and cross joins, where multiple matches are usually expected, this defaults to returning `""all""` of the matches. You can also return only the `""first""` or `""last""` match, `""any""` of the matches, or you can `""error""`."
dplyr,83,2,92,"`keep` now defaults to `NULL` rather than `FALSE`. `NULL` implies `keep = FALSE` for equi-join conditions, but `keep = TRUE` for non-equi join conditions, since you generally want to preserve both sides of a non-equi join."
dplyr,83,2,93,"`unmatched` is a new argument for controlling what happens when a row would be dropped because it doesn't have a match. For backwards compatibility, the default is `""drop""`, but you can also choose to `""error""` if dropped rows would be surprising."
dplyr,NA,1,94,`nest_join()` has gained the `na_matches` argument that all other joins have.
dplyr,NA,1,96,"New `rows_append()` which works like `rows_insert()` but ignores keys and allows you to insert arbitrary rows with a guarantee that the type of `x` won't change (#6249, thanks to @krlmlr for the implementation and @mgirlich for the idea)."
dplyr,NA,1,97,"The `rows_*()` functions no longer require that the key values in `x` uniquely identify each row. Additionally, `rows_insert()` and `rows_delete()` no longer require that the key values in `y` uniquely identify each row. Relaxing this restriction should make these functions more practically useful for data frames, and alternative backends can enforce this in other ways as needed (i.e. through primary keys) (#5553)."
dplyr,NA,1,98,"`rows_insert()` gained a new `conflict` argument allowing you greater control over rows in `y` with keys that conflict with keys in `x`. A conflict arises if a key in `y` already exists in `x`. By default, a conflict results in an error, but you can now also `""ignore""` these `y` rows. This is very similar to the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` command from SQL (#5588, with helpful additions from @mgirlich and @krlmlr)."
dplyr,NA,1,99,"`rows_update()`, `rows_patch()`, and `rows_delete()` gained a new `unmatched` argument allowing you greater control over rows in `y` with keys that are unmatched by the keys in `x`. By default, an unmatched key results in an error, but you can now also `""ignore""` these `y` rows (#5984, #5699)."
dplyr,NA,1,100,"`rows_delete()` no longer requires that the columns of `y` be a strict subset of `x`. Only the columns specified through `by` will be utilized from `y`, all others will be dropped with a message."
dplyr,NA,1,101,"The `rows_*()` functions now always retain the column types of `x`. This behavior was documented, but previously wasn't being applied correctly (#6240)."
dplyr,NA,1,102,The `rows_*()` functions now fail elegantly if `y` is a zero column data frame and `by` isn't specified (#6179).
dplyr,NA,1,103,Better display of error messages thanks to rlang 1.0.0.
dplyr,NA,1,104,"`mutate(.keep = ""none"")` is no longer identical to `transmute()`. `transmute()` has not been changed, and completely ignores the column ordering of the existing data, instead relying on the ordering of expressions supplied through `...`. `mutate(.keep = ""none"")` has been changed to ensure that pre-existing columns are never moved, which aligns more closely with the other `.keep` options (#6086)."
dplyr,NA,1,105,"`filter()` forbids matrix results (#5973) and warns about data frame results, especially data frames created from `across()` with a hint to use `if_any()` or `if_all()`."
dplyr,NA,1,106,"`slice()` helpers (`slice_head()`, `slice_tail()`, `slice_min()`, `slice_max()`) now accept negative values for `n` and `prop` (#5961)."
dplyr,NA,1,107,`slice()` now indicates which group produces an error (#5931).
dplyr,NA,1,108,`cur_data()` and `cur_data_all()` don't simplify list columns in rowwise data frames (#5901).
dplyr,NA,1,109,dplyr now uses `rlang::check_installed()` to prompt you whether to install required packages that are missing.

dplyr,NA,1,119,Multiple calls to `if_any()` and/or `if_all()` in the same expression are now properly disambiguated (#5782).
dplyr,NA,1,120,`filter()` now inlines `if_any()` and `if_all()` expressions. This greatly improves performance with grouped data frames.
dplyr,NA,1,121,"Fixed behaviour of `...` in top-level `across()` calls (#5813, #5832)."
dplyr,NA,1,122,`across()` now inlines lambda-formulas. This is slightly more performant and will allow more optimisations in the future.
dplyr,NA,1,123,"Fixed issue in `bind_rows()` causing lists to be incorrectly transformed as data frames (#5417, #5749)."
dplyr,NA,1,124,`select()` no longer creates duplicate variables when renaming a variable to the same name as a grouping variable (#5841).
dplyr,NA,1,125,"`dplyr_col_select()` keeps attributes for bare data frames (#5294, #5831)."
dplyr,NA,1,126,Fixed quosure handling in `dplyr::group_by()` that caused issues with extra arguments (tidyverse/lubridate#959).
dplyr,NA,1,127,"Removed the `name` argument from the `compute()` generic (@ianmcook, #5783)."

dplyr,NA,1,133,`group_by()` keeps attributes unrelated to the grouping (#5760).
dplyr,NA,1,134,The `.cols=` argument of `if_any()` and `if_all()` defaults to `everything()`.
dplyr,NA,1,135,Improved performance for `across()`. This makes `summarise(across())` and `mutate(across())` perform as well as the superseded colwise equivalents (#5697).
dplyr,NA,1,136,"New functions `if_any()` and `if_all()` (#4770, #5713)."
dplyr,NA,1,137,`summarise()` silently ignores NULL results (#5708).
dplyr,NA,1,138,Fixed a performance regression in `mutate()` when warnings occur once per group (#5675). We no longer instrument warnings with debugging information when `mutate()` is called within `suppressWarnings()`.
dplyr,NA,1,139,`summarise()` no longer informs when the result is ungrouped (#5633).
dplyr,NA,1,140,"`group_by(.drop = FALSE)` preserves ordered factors (@brianrice2, #5545)."
dplyr,NA,1,141,`count()` and `tally()` are now generic.
dplyr,NA,1,142,"Removed default fallbacks to lazyeval methods; this will yield better error messages when you call a dplyr function with the wrong input, and is part of our long term plan to remove the deprecated lazyeval interface."
dplyr,NA,1,143,"`inner_join()` gains a `keep` parameter for consistency with the other mutating joins (@patrickbarks, #5581)."

dplyr,NA,1,156,"`summarise(.groups = ""rowwise"")` makes a rowwise data frame even if the input data is not grouped (#5422)."
dplyr,NA,1,157,New function `cur_data_all()` similar to `cur_data()` but includes the grouping variables (#5342).
dplyr,NA,1,158,"`count()` and `tally()` no longer automatically weights by column `n` if present (#5298). dplyr 1.0.0 introduced this behaviour because of Hadley's faulty memory. Historically `tally()` automatically weighted and `count()` did not, but this behaviour was accidentally changed in 0.8.2 (#4408) so that neither automatically weighted by `n`. Since 0.8.2 is almost a year old, and the automatically weighting behaviour was a little confusing anyway, we've removed it from both `count()` and `tally()`."
dplyr,NA,1,159,Use of `wt = n()` is now deprecated; now just omit the `wt` argument.
dplyr,NA,1,160,`coalesce()` now supports data frames correctly (#5326).
dplyr,NA,1,161,"`cummean()` no longer has off-by-one indexing problem (@cropgen, #5287)."

dplyr,NA,1,163,"`bind_cols()` no longer converts to a tibble, returns a data frame if the input is a data frame."
dplyr,NA,1,164,"`bind_rows()`, `*_join()`, `summarise()` and `mutate()` use vctrs coercion rules. There are two main user facing changes:"
dplyr,164,2,165,Combining factor and character vectors silently creates a character vector; previously it created a character vector with a warning.
dplyr,164,2,166,Combining multiple factors creates a factor with combined levels; previously it created a character vector with a warning.
dplyr,NA,1,167,"`bind_rows()` and other functions use vctrs name repair, see `?vctrs::vec_as_names`."
dplyr,NA,1,168,`all.equal.tbl_df()` removed.
dplyr,168,2,169,"Data frames, tibbles and grouped data frames are no longer considered equal, even if the data is the same."
dplyr,168,2,170,Equality checks for data frames no longer ignore row order or groupings.

dplyr,NA,1,172,`distinct()` keeps the original column order.
dplyr,NA,1,173,"`distinct()` on missing columns now raises an error, it has been a compatibility warning for a long time."
dplyr,NA,1,174,`group_modify()` puts the grouping variable to the front.
dplyr,NA,1,175,"`n()` and `row_number()` can no longer be called directly when dplyr is not loaded, and this now generates an error: `dplyr::mutate(mtcars, x = n())`."
dplyr,NA,1,176,"Fix by prefixing with `dplyr::` as in `dplyr::mutate(mtcars, x = dplyr::n())`"
dplyr,NA,1,177,"The old data format for `grouped_df` is no longer supported. This may affect you if you have serialized grouped data frames to disk, e.g. with `saveRDS()` or when using knitr caching."
dplyr,NA,1,178,`lead()` and `lag()` are stricter about their inputs.
dplyr,NA,1,179,"Extending data frames requires that the extra class or classes are added first, not last. Having the extra class at the end causes some vctrs operations to fail with a message like:"
dplyr,NA,1,180,`right_join()` no longer sorts the rows of the resulting tibble according to the order of the RHS `by` argument in tibble `y`.
dplyr,NA,1,181,"The `cur_` functions (`cur_data()`, `cur_group()`, `cur_group_id()`, `cur_group_rows()`) provide a full set of options to you access information about the ""current"" group in dplyr verbs. They are inspired by data.table's `.SD`, `.GRP`, `.BY`, and `.I`."
dplyr,NA,1,182,"The `rows_` functions (`rows_insert()`, `rows_update()`, `rows_upsert()`, `rows_patch()`, `rows_delete()`) provide a new API to insert and delete rows from a second data frame or table. Support for updating mutable backends is planned (#4654)."
dplyr,NA,1,183,`mutate()` and `summarise()` create multiple columns from a single expression if you return a data frame (#2326).
dplyr,NA,1,184,"`select()` and `rename()` use the latest version of the tidyselect interface. Practically, this means that you can now combine selections using Boolean logic (i.e. `!`, `&` and `|`), and use predicate functions with `where()` (e.g. `where(is.character)`) to select variables by type (#4680). It also makes it possible to use `select()` and `rename()` to repair data frames with duplicated names (#4615) and prevents you from accidentally introducing duplicate names (#4643). This also means that dplyr now re-exports `any_of()` and `all_of()` (#5036)."
dplyr,NA,1,185,`slice()` gains a new set of helpers:
dplyr,185,2,186,"`slice_head()` and `slice_tail()` select the first and last rows, like `head()` and `tail()`, but return `n` rows *per group*."
dplyr,185,2,187,"`slice_sample()` randomly selects rows, taking over from `sample_frac()` and `sample_n()`."
dplyr,185,2,188,"`slice_min()` and `slice_max()` select the rows with the minimum or maximum values of a variable, taking over from the confusing `top_n()`."
dplyr,NA,1,189,`summarise()` can create summaries of greater than length 1 if you use a summary function that returns multiple values.
dplyr,NA,1,190,`summarise()` gains a `.groups=` argument to control the grouping structure.
dplyr,NA,1,191,New `relocate()` verb makes it easy to move columns around within a data frame (#4598).

dplyr,NA,1,196,"`mutate()` (for data frames only), gains an experimental new argument called `.keep` that allows you to control which variables are kept from the input `.data`. `.keep = ""all""` is the default; it keeps all variables. `.keep = ""none""` retains no input variables (except for grouping keys), so behaves like `transmute()`. `.keep = ""unused""` keeps only variables not used to make new columns. `.keep = ""used""` keeps only the input variables used to create new columns; it's useful for double checking your work (#3721)."
dplyr,NA,1,197,"New, experimental, `with_groups()` makes it easy to temporarily group or ungroup (#4711)."
dplyr,NA,1,198,"New function `across()` that can be used inside `summarise()`, `mutate()`, and other verbs to apply a function (or a set of functions) to a selection of columns. See `vignette(""colwise"")` for more details."
dplyr,NA,1,199,"New function `c_across()` that can be used inside `summarise()` and `mutate()` in row-wise data frames to easily (e.g.) compute a row-wise mean of all numeric variables. See `vignette(""rowwise"")` for more details."
dplyr,NA,1,200,`rowwise()` is no longer questioning; we now understand that it's an important tool when you don't have vectorised code. It now also allows you to specify additional variables that should be preserved in the output when summarising (#4723). The rowwise-ness is preserved by all operations; you need to explicit drop it with `as_tibble()` or `group_by()`.
dplyr,NA,1,201,"New, experimental, `nest_by()`. It has the same interface as `group_by()`, but returns a rowwise data frame of grouping keys, supplemental with a list-column of data frames containing the rest of the data."
dplyr,NA,1,202,"The implementation of all dplyr verbs have been changed to use primitives provided by the vctrs package. This makes it easier to add support for new types of vector, radically simplifies the implementation, and makes all dplyr verbs more consistent."
dplyr,NA,1,203,"The place where you are mostly likely to be impacted by the coercion changes is when working with factors in joins or grouped mutates: now when combining factors with different levels, dplyr creates a new factor with the union of the levels. This matches base R more closely, and while perhaps strictly less correct, is much more convenient."
dplyr,NA,1,204,dplyr dropped its two heaviest dependencies: Rcpp and BH. This should make it considerably easier and faster to build from source.
dplyr,NA,1,205,"The implementation of all verbs has been carefully thought through. This mostly makes implementation simpler but should hopefully increase consistency, and also makes it easier to adapt to dplyr to new data structures in the new future. Pragmatically, the biggest difference for most people will be that each verb documents its return value in terms of rows, columns, groups, and data frame attributes."
dplyr,NA,1,206,Row names are now preserved when working with data frames.
dplyr,NA,1,207,`group_by()` uses hashing from the `vctrs` package.
dplyr,NA,1,208,"Grouped data frames now have `names<-`, `[[<-`, `[<-` and `$<-` methods that re-generate the underlying grouping. Note that modifying grouping variables in multiple steps (i.e. `df$grp1 <- 1; df$grp2 <- 1`) will be inefficient since the data frame will be regrouped after each modification."
dplyr,NA,1,209,`[.grouped_df` now regroups to respect any grouping columns that have been removed (#4708).

dplyr,NA,1,246,"dplyr no longer provides a `all.equal.tbl_df()` method. It never should have done so in the first place because it owns neither the generic nor the class. It also provided a problematic implementation because, by default, it ignored the order of the rows and the columns which is usually important. This is likely to cause new test failures in downstream packages; but on the whole we believe those failures to either reflect unexpected behaviour or tests that need to be strengthened (#2751)."

dplyr,NA,1,255,"The first argument of `group_map()`, `group_modify()` and `group_walk()` has been changed to `.data` for consistency with other generics."
dplyr,NA,1,256,`group_keys.rowwise_df()` gives a 0 column data frame with `n()` rows.
dplyr,NA,1,257,`group_map()` is now a generic (#4576).
dplyr,NA,1,258,"`group_by(..., .add = TRUE)` replaces `group_by(..., add = TRUE)`, with a deprecation message. The old argument name was a mistake because it prevents you from creating a new grouping var called `add` and it violates our naming conventions (#4137)."
dplyr,NA,1,259,"`intersect()`, `union()`, `setdiff()` and `setequal()` generics are now imported from the generics package. This reduces a conflict with lubridate."

dplyr,NA,1,261,"`tally()` and `count()` now message if the default output `name` (n), already exists in the data frame. To quiet the message, you'll need to supply an explicit `name` (#4284). You can override the default weighting to using a constant by setting `wt = 1`."
dplyr,NA,1,262,"`starwars` dataset now does a better job of separating biological sex from gender identity. The previous `gender` column has been renamed to `sex`, since it actually describes the individual's biological sex.

dplyr,NA,1,313,`last_col()` is re-exported from tidyselect (#3584).
dplyr,NA,1,314,`group_trim()` drops unused levels of factors that are used as grouping variables.

dplyr,NA,1,320,"`group_by()` gains the `.drop` argument. When set to `FALSE` the groups are generated based on factor levels, hence some groups may be empty (#341)."
dplyr,NA,1,321,The default behaviour drops the empty groups as in the previous versions.
dplyr,NA,1,322,"`filter()` and `slice()` gain a `.preserve` argument to control which groups it should keep. The default `filter(.preserve = FALSE)` recalculates the grouping structure based on the resulting data, otherwise it is kept as is."
dplyr,NA,1,323,"The notion of lazily grouped data frames have disappeared. All dplyr verbs now recalculate immediately the grouping structure, and respect the levels of factors."
dplyr,NA,1,324,"Subsets of columns now properly dispatch to the `[` or `[[` method when the column is an object (a vector with a class) instead of making assumptions on how the column should be handled. The `[` method must handle integer indices, including `NA_integer_`, i.e. `x[NA_integer_]` should produce a vector of the same class as `x` with whatever represents a missing value."
dplyr,NA,1,325,`tally()` works correctly on non-data frame table sources such as `tbl_sql` (#3075).
dplyr,NA,1,326,`sample_n()` and `sample_frac()` can use `n()` (#3527)

dplyr,NA,1,344,R expressions that cannot be handled with native code are now evaluated with unwind-protection when available (on R 3.5 and later). This improves the performance of dplyr on data frames with many groups (and hence many expressions to evaluate). We benchmarked that computing a grouped average is consistently twice as fast with unwind-protection enabled.
dplyr,NA,1,345,"Unwind-protection also makes dplyr more robust in corner cases because it ensures the C++ destructors are correctly called in all circumstances (debugger exit, captured condition, restart invokation)."

The grouping tibble consists of one column per grouping variable, followed by a list column of the (1-based) indices of the groups. The new `group_rows()` function retrieves that list of indices (#3489)."
dplyr,NA,1,352,Hybrid evaluation has been completely redesigned for better performance and stability.
dplyr,NA,1,353,Add documentation example for moving variable to back in `?select` (#3051).
dplyr,NA,1,354,"column wise functions are better documented, in particular explaining when grouping variables are included as part of the selection."

dplyr,NA,1,360,Fix rchk errors (#3693).
dplyr,NA,1,361,"The major change in this version is that dplyr now depends on the selecting backend of the tidyselect package. If you have been linking to `dplyr::select_helpers` documentation topic, you should update the link to point to `tidyselect::select_helpers`."
dplyr,NA,1,362,"Another change that causes warnings in packages is that dplyr now exports the `exprs()` function. This causes a collision with `Biobase::exprs()`. Either import functions from dplyr selectively rather than in bulk, or do not import `Biobase::exprs()` and refer to it with a namespace qualifier."

dplyr,NA,1,365,"Reindexing grouped data frames (e.g. after `filter()` or `..._join()`) never updates the `""class""` attribute. This also avoids unintended updates to the original object (#3438)."
dplyr,NA,1,366,Fixed rare column name clash in `..._join()` with non-join columns of the same name in both tables (#3266).
dplyr,NA,1,367,"Fix `ntile()` and `row_number()` ordering to use the locale-dependent ordering functions in R when dealing with character vectors, rather than always using the C-locale ordering function in C (#2792, @foo-bar-baz-qux)."

dplyr,NA,1,371,"dplyr now depends on the new tidyselect package to power `select()`, `rename()`, `pull()` and their variants (#2896). Consequently `select_vars()`, `select_var()` and `rename_vars()` are soft-deprecated and will start issuing warnings in a future version."
dplyr,NA,1,372,"Following the switch to tidyselect, `select()` and `rename()` fully support character vectors. You can now unquote variables like this:"
dplyr,NA,1,373,"Note that this only works in selecting functions because in other contexts strings and character vectors are ambiguous. For instance strings are a valid input in mutating operations and `mutate(df, ""foo"")` creates a new column by recycling ""foo"" to the number of rows."

ggplot2,NA,1,271,"`position_dodge()` gains a `preserve` argument that allows you to control whether the `total` width at each `x` value is preserved (the current default), or ensure that the width of a `single` element is preserved (what many people want) (#1935)."
ggplot2,NA,1,272,"New `position_dodge2()` provides enhanced dodging for boxplots. Compared to `position_dodge()`, `position_dodge2()` compares `xmin` and `xmax` values\ to determine which elements overlap, and spreads overlapping elements evenly within the region of overlap. `position_dodge2()` is now the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`, because it handles `varwidth = TRUE`, and will be considered for other geoms in the future."
ggplot2,NA,1,273,"The `padding` parameter adds a small amount of padding between elements (@karawoo, #2143) and a `reverse` parameter allows you to reverse the order of placement (@karawoo, #2171)."

ggplot2,NA,1,276,"Improved support for ordered factors. Ordered factors throw a warning when mapped to shape (unordered factors do not), and do not throw warnings when mapped to size or alpha (unordered factors do). Viridis is used as the default colour and fill scale for ordered factors (@karawoo, #1526)."
ggplot2,NA,1,277,The `expand` argument of `scale_*_continuous()` and `scale_*_discrete()` now accepts separate expansion values for the lower and upper range limits. The expansion limits can be specified using the convenience function `expand_scale()`.
ggplot2,NA,1,278,"Separate expansion limits may be useful for bar charts, e.g. if one wants the bottom of the bars to be flush with the x axis but still leave some (automatically calculated amount of) space above them:"
ggplot2,NA,1,279,"It can also be useful for line charts, e.g. for counts over time, where one wants to have a 'hard' lower limit of y = 0 but leave the upper limit unspecified (and perhaps differing between panels), with some extra space above the highest point on the line (with symmetrical limits, the extra space above the highest point could in some cases cause the lower limit to be negative)."

ggplot2,NA,1,285,Rotated strip labels now correctly understand `hjust` and `vjust` parameters at all angles (@karawoo).
ggplot2,NA,1,286,"Strip labels now understand justification relative to the direction of the text, meaning that in y facets, the strip text can be placed at either end of the strip using `hjust` (@karawoo)."
ggplot2,NA,1,287,"Legend titles and labels get a little extra space around them, which prevents legend titles from overlapping the legend at large font sizes (@karawoo, #1881)."
ggplot2,NA,1,288,"New `autolayer()` S3 generic (@mitchelloharawild, #1974). This is similar to `autoplot()` but produces layers rather than complete plots."

ggplot2,NA,1,290,"Theme elements can now be subclassed. Add a `merge_element` method to control how properties are inherited from the parent element. Add an `element_grob` method to define how elements are rendered into grobs (@thomasp85, #1981)."
ggplot2,NA,1,291,Coords have gained new extension mechanisms.
ggplot2,NA,1,292,"If you have an existing coord extension, you will need to revise the specification of the `train()` method. It is now called `setup_panel_params()` (better reflecting what it actually does) and now has arguments `scale_x`, and `scale_y` (the x and y scales respectively) and `param`, a list of plot specific parameters generated by `setup_params()`."
ggplot2,NA,1,293,"What was formerly called `scale_details` (in coords), `panel_ranges` (in layout) and `panel_scales` (in geoms) are now consistently called `panel_params` (#1311). These are parameters of the coord that vary from panel to panel."
ggplot2,NA,1,294,"`ggplot_build()` and `ggplot_gtable()` are now generics, so ggplot-subclasses can define additional behavior during the build stage."
ggplot2,NA,1,295,"`guide_train()`, `guide_merge()`, `guide_geom()`, and `guide_gengrob()` are now exported as they are needed if you want to design your own guide. They are not currently documented; use at your own risk (#2528)."

ggplot2,NA,1,306,Legends now ignore set aesthetics that are not length one (#1932).
ggplot2,NA,1,307,"All colour and fill scales now have an `aesthetics` argument that can be used to set the aesthetic(s) the scale works with.

ggplot2,NA,1,333,Themes now set default grid colour in `panel.grid` rather than individually in `panel.grid.major` and `panel.grid.minor` individually. This makes it slightly easier to customise the theme (#2352).
ggplot2,NA,1,334,Fixed bug when setting strips to `element_blank()` (@thomasp85).

ggplot2,NA,1,368,`scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` can now display a secondary axis that is a **one-to-one** transformation of the primary axis (e.g. degrees Celcius to degrees Fahrenheit). The secondary axis will be positioned opposite to the primary axis and can be controlled with the `sec.axis` argument to the scale constructor.
ggplot2,NA,1,369,"Scales worry less about having breaks. If no breaks can be computed, the plot will work instead of throwing an uninformative error (#791). This is particularly helpful when you have facets with free scales, and not all panels contain data."

ggplot2,NA,1,391,"When computing the height of titles, ggplot2 now includes the height of the descenders (i.e. the bits of `g` and `y` that hang beneath the baseline).

ggplot2,NA,1,410,"`geom_violin()` no longer transforms quantile lines with the alpha aesthetic (@mnbram, #1714). It no longer errors when quantiles are requested but data have zero range (#1687). When `trim = FALSE` it once again has a nice range that allows the density to reach zero (by extending the range 3 bandwidths to either side of the data) (#1700)."

ggplot2,NA,1,419,`stat_ecdf()` respects `pad` argument (#1646).
ggplot2,NA,1,420,`stat_smooth()` once again informs you about the method it has chosen. It also correctly calculates the size of the largest group within facets.
ggplot2,NA,1,421,"`x` and `y` scales are now symmetric regarding the list of aesthetics they accept: `xmin_final`, `xmax_final`, `xlower`, `xmiddle` and `xupper` are now valid `x` aesthetics."
ggplot2,NA,1,422,`Scale` extensions can now override the `make_title` and `make_sec_title` methods to let the scale modify the axis/legend titles.

ggplot2,NA,1,427,"`stat_bin()` has been overhauled to use the same algorithm as ggvis, which has been considerably improved thanks to the advice of Randy Prium (@rpruim). This includes:"
ggplot2,427,2,428,Better arguments and a better algorithm for determining the origin. You can now specify either `boundary` or the `center` of a bin. `origin` has been deprecated in favour of these arguments.
ggplot2,427,2,429,"`drop` is deprecated in favour of `pad`, which adds extra 0-count bins at either end (needed for frequency polygons). `geom_histogram()` defaults to `pad = FALSE` which considerably improves the default limits for the histogram, especially when the bins are big (#1477)."

ggplot2,427,2,431,"`bins = n` now gives a histogram with `n` bins, not `n + 1` (#1487)."
ggplot2,NA,1,432,All `\donttest{}` examples run.
ggplot2,NA,1,433,"All `geom_()` and `stat_()` functions now have consistent argument order: data + mapping, then geom/stat/position, then `...`, then specific arguments, then arguments common to all layers (#1305). This may break code if you were previously relying on partial name matching, but in the long-term should make ggplot2 easier to use. In particular, you can now set the `n` parameter in `geom_density2d()` without it partially matching `na.rm` (#1485)."
ggplot2,NA,1,434,"For geoms with both `colour` and `fill`, `alpha` once again only affects fill (Reverts #1371, #1523). This was causing problems for people."

ggplot2,NA,1,442,`layer()` now automatically adds a `na.rm` parameter if none is explicitly supplied.
ggplot2,NA,1,443,"`position_jitterdodge()` now works on all possible dodge aesthetics, e.g. `color`, `linetype` etc. instead of only based on `fill` (@bleutner)"
ggplot2,NA,1,444,"`position = ""nudge""` now works (although it doesn't do anything useful) (#1428)."
ggplot2,NA,1,445,"The default scale for columns of class ""AsIs"" is now ""identity"" (#1518)."
ggplot2,NA,1,446,`scale_*_discrete()` has better defaults when used with purely continuous data (#1542).
ggplot2,NA,1,447,`scale_size()` warns when used with categorical data.
ggplot2,NA,1,448,"`scale_size()`, `scale_colour()`, and `scale_fill()` gain date and date-time variants (#1526)."
ggplot2,NA,1,449,"`stat_bin_hex()` and `stat_bin_summary()` now use the same underlying algorithm so results are consistent (#1383). `stat_bin_hex()` now accepts a `weight` aesthetic. To be consistent with related stats, the output variable from `stat_bin_hex()` is now value instead of count."
ggplot2,NA,1,450,`stat_density()` gains a `bw` parameter which makes it easy to get consistent smoothing between facets (@jiho)
ggplot2,NA,1,451,"`stat-density-2d()` no longer ignores the `h` parameter, and now accepts `bins` and `binwidth` parameters to control the number of contours (#1448, @has2k1)."
ggplot2,NA,1,452,"`stat_ecdf()` does a better job of adding padding to -Inf/Inf, and gains an argument `pad` to suppress the padding if not needed (#1467)."
ggplot2,NA,1,453,`stat_function()` gains an `xlim` parameter (#1528). It once again works with discrete x values (#1509).
ggplot2,NA,1,454,`stat_summary()` preserves sorted x order which avoids artefacts when display results with `geom_smooth()` (#1520).
ggplot2,NA,1,455,"All elements should now inherit correctly for all themes except `theme_void()`. (@Katiedaisey, #1555)"
ggplot2,NA,1,456,`theme_void()` was completely void of text but facets and legends still need labels. They are now visible (@jiho).
ggplot2,NA,1,457,"You can once again set legend key and height width to unit arithmetic objects (like `2 * unit(1, ""cm"")`) (#1437)."
ggplot2,NA,1,458,Eliminate spurious warning if you have a layer with no data and no aesthetics (#1451).
ggplot2,NA,1,459,Removed a superfluous comma in `theme-defaults.r` code (@jschoeley)
ggplot2,NA,1,460,Fixed a compatibility issue with `ggproto` and R versions prior to 3.1.2. (#1444)
ggplot2,NA,1,461,"Fixed issue where `coord_map()` fails when given an explicit `parameters` argument (@tdmcarthur, #1729)"
ggplot2,NA,1,462,Fixed issue where `geom_errorbarh()` had a required `x` aesthetic (#1933)
ggplot2,NA,1,463,ggplot no longer throws an error if your plot has no layers. Instead it automatically adds `geom_blank()` (#1246).
ggplot2,NA,1,464,"New `cut_width()` is a convenient replacement for the verbose `plyr::round_any()`, with the additional benefit of offering finer control."
ggplot2,NA,1,465,New `geom_count()` is a convenient alias to `stat_sum()`. Use it when you have overlapping points on a scatterplot. `stat_sum()` now defaults to using counts instead of proportions.
ggplot2,NA,1,466,"New `geom_curve()` adds curved lines, with a similar specification to `geom_segment()` (@veraanadi, #1088)."
ggplot2,NA,1,467,"Date and datetime scales now have `date_breaks`, `date_minor_breaks` and `date_labels` arguments so that you never need to use the long `scales::date_breaks()` or `scales::date_format()`."
ggplot2,NA,1,468,"`geom_bar()` now has it's own stat, distinct from `stat_bin()` which was also used by `geom_histogram()`. `geom_bar()` now uses `stat_count()` which counts values at each distinct value of x (i.e. it does not bin the data first). This can be useful when you want to show exactly which values are used in a continuous variable."
ggplot2,NA,1,469,"`geom_point()` gains a `stroke` aesthetic which controls the border width of shapes 21-25 (#1133, @SeySayux). `size` and `stroke` are additive so a point with `size = 5` and `stroke = 5` will have a diameter of 10mm. (#1142)"
ggplot2,NA,1,470,New `position_nudge()` allows you to slightly offset labels (or other geoms) from their corresponding points (#1109).
ggplot2,NA,1,471,"`scale_size()` now maps values to *area*, not radius. Use `scale_radius()` if you want the old behaviour (not recommended, except perhaps for lines)."
ggplot2,NA,1,472,"New `stat_summary_bin()` works like `stat_summary()` but on binned data. It's a generalisation of `stat_bin()` that can compute any aggregate, not just counts (#1274). Both default to `mean_se()` if no aggregation functions are supplied (#1386)."
ggplot2,NA,1,473,Layers are now much stricter about their arguments - you will get an error if you've supplied an argument that isn't an aesthetic or a parameter. This is likely to cause some short-term pain but in the long-term it will make it much easier to spot spelling mistakes and other errors (#1293).
ggplot2,NA,1,474,"This change does break a handful of geoms/stats that used `...` to pass additional arguments on to the underlying computation. Now `geom_smooth()`/`stat_smooth()` and `geom_quantile()`/`stat_quantile()` use `method.args` instead (#1245, #1289); and `stat_summary()` (#1242), `stat_summary_hex()`, and `stat_summary2d()` use `fun.args`."
ggplot2,NA,1,476,"All Geoms, Stats and Positions are now exported, so you can inherit from them when making your own objects (#989)."
ggplot2,NA,1,477,"ggplot2 no longer uses proto or reference classes. Instead, we now use ggproto, a new OO system designed specifically for ggplot2. Unlike proto and RC, ggproto supports clean cross-package inheritance. Creating a new OO system isn't usually the right way to solve a problem, but I'm pretty sure it was necessary here. Read more about it in the vignette."
ggplot2,NA,1,478,"`aes_()` replaces `aes_q()`. It also supports formulas, so the most concise SE version of `aes(carat, price)` is now `aes_(~carat, ~price)`. You may want to use this form in packages, as it will avoid spurious `R CMD check` warnings about undefined global variables."
ggplot2,NA,1,479,`geom_text()` has been overhauled to make labelling your data a little easier. It:
ggplot2,479,2,480,`nudge_x` and `nudge_y` arguments let you offset labels from their corresponding points (#1120).
ggplot2,479,2,481,`check_overlap = TRUE` provides a simple way to avoid overplotting of labels: labels that would otherwise overlap are omitted (#1039).
ggplot2,479,2,482,"`hjust` and `vjust` can now be character vectors: ""left"", ""center"", ""right"", ""bottom"", ""middle"", ""top"". New options include ""inward"" and ""outward"" which align text towards and away from the center of the plot respectively."
ggplot2,NA,1,483,`geom_label()` works like `geom_text()` but draws a rounded rectangle underneath each label (#1039). This is useful when you want to label plots that are dense with data.
ggplot2,NA,1,484,The little used `aes_auto()` has been deprecated.
ggplot2,NA,1,485,`aes_q()` has been replaced with `aes_()` to be consistent with SE versions of NSE functions in other packages.
ggplot2,NA,1,486,"The `order` aesthetic is officially deprecated. It never really worked, and was poorly documented."
ggplot2,NA,1,487,"The `stat` and `position` arguments to `qplot()` have been deprecated. `qplot()` is designed for quick plots - if you need to specify position or stat, use `ggplot()` instead."
ggplot2,NA,1,488,The theme setting `axis.ticks.margin` has been deprecated: now use the margin property of `axis.text`.
ggplot2,NA,1,489,"`stat_abline()`, `stat_hline()` and `stat_vline()` have been removed: these were never suitable for use other than with `geom_abline()` etc and were not documented."
ggplot2,NA,1,490,"`show_guide` has been renamed to `show.legend`: this more accurately reflects what it does (controls appearance of layer in legend), and uses the same convention as other ggplot2 arguments (i.e. a `.` between names). (Yes, I know that's inconsistent with function names with use `_`, but it's too late to change now.)"
ggplot2,NA,1,492,"`stat_binhex()` and `stat_bin2d()` have been renamed to `stat_bin_hex()` and `stat_bin_2d()` (#1274). `stat_summary2d()` has been renamed to `stat_summary_2d()`, `geom_density2d()`/`stat_density2d()` has been renamed to `geom_density_2d()`/`stat_density_2d()`."
ggplot2,NA,1,493,`stat_spoke()` is now `geom_spoke()` since I realised it's a reparameterisation of `geom_segment()`.
ggplot2,NA,1,494,"`stat_bindot()` has been removed because it's so tightly coupled to `geom_dotplot()`. If you happened to use `stat_bindot()`, just change to `geom_dotplot()` (#1194)."
ggplot2,NA,1,496,"The default `theme_grey()` background colour has been changed from ""grey90"" to ""grey92"": this makes the background a little less visually prominent."
ggplot2,NA,1,497,Labels and titles have been tweaked for readability:
ggplot2,497,2,498,Axes labels are darker.
ggplot2,497,2,499,Legend and axis titles are given the same visual treatment.
ggplot2,497,2,500,"The default font size dropped from 12 to 11. You might be surprised that I've made the default text size smaller as it was already hard for many people to read. It turns out there was a bug in RStudio (fixed in 0.99.724), that shrunk the text of all grid based graphics. Once that was resolved the defaults seemed too big to my eyes."
ggplot2,497,2,501,More spacing between titles and borders.
ggplot2,497,2,502,"Default margins scale with the theme font size, so the appearance at larger font sizes should be considerably improved (#1228)."
ggplot2,NA,1,503,`alpha` now affects both fill and colour aesthetics (#1371).
ggplot2,NA,1,504,`element_text()` gains a margins argument which allows you to add additional padding around text elements. To help see what's going on use `debug = TRUE` to display the text region and anchors.
ggplot2,NA,1,505,The default font size in `geom_text()` has been decreased from 5mm (14 pts) to 3.8 mm (11 pts) to match the new default theme sizes.
ggplot2,NA,1,506,"A diagonal line is no longer drawn on bar and rectangle legends. Instead, the border has been tweaked to be more visible, and more closely match the size of line drawn on the plot."
ggplot2,NA,1,507,`geom_pointrange()` and `geom_linerange()` get vertical (not horizontal) lines in the legend (#1389).
ggplot2,NA,1,508,The default line `size` for `geom_smooth()` has been increased from 0.5 to 1 to make it easier to see when overlaid on data.
ggplot2,NA,1,509,`geom_bar()` and `geom_rect()` use a slightly paler shade of grey so they aren't so visually heavy.
ggplot2,NA,1,510,`geom_boxplot()` now colours outliers the same way as the boxes.
ggplot2,NA,1,511,"`geom_point()` now uses shape 19 instead of 16. This looks much better on the default Linux graphics device. (It's very slightly smaller than the old point, but it shouldn't affect any graphics significantly)"
ggplot2,NA,1,512,"Sizes in ggplot2 are measured in mm. Previously they were converted to pts (for use in grid) by multiplying by 72 / 25.4. However, grid uses printer's points, not Adobe (big pts), so sizes are now correctly multiplied by 72.27 / 25.4. This is unlikely to noticeably affect display, but it's technically correct (<https://youtu.be/hou0lU8WMgo>)."
ggplot2,NA,1,513,The default legend will now allocate multiple rows (if vertical) or columns (if horizontal) in order to make a legend that is more likely to fit on the screen. You can override with the `nrow`/`ncol` arguments to `guide_legend()`
ggplot2,NA,1,514,"New `theme_void()` is completely empty. It's useful for plots with non- standard coordinates or for drawings (@jiho, #976)."
ggplot2,NA,1,515,"New `theme_dark()` has a dark background designed to make colours pop out (@jiho, #1018)"
ggplot2,NA,1,516,"`theme_minimal()` became slightly more minimal by removing the axis ticks: labels now line up directly beneath grid lines (@tomschloss, #1084)"
ggplot2,NA,1,517,"New theme setting `panel.ontop` (logical) make it possible to place background elements (i.e., gridlines) on top of data. Best used with transparent `panel.background` (@noamross. #551)."
ggplot2,NA,1,519,`facet_wrap()` gains a `labeller` option (#25).
ggplot2,NA,1,520,"`facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()` gain a `switch` argument to display the facet titles near the axes. When switched, the labels become axes subtitles. `switch` can be set to ""x"", ""y"" or ""both"" (the latter only for grids) to control which margin is switched."
ggplot2,NA,1,522,They now offer the `multi_line` argument to control whether to display composite facets (those specified as `~var1 + var2`) on one or multiple lines.
ggplot2,NA,1,523,"In `label_bquote()` you now refer directly to the names of variables. With this change, you can create math expressions that depend on more than one variable. This math expression can be specified either for the rows or the columns and you can also provide different expressions to each margin."
ggplot2,NA,1,524,"As a consequence of these changes, referring to `x` in backquoted expressions is deprecated."
ggplot2,NA,1,525,"Similarly to `label_bquote()`, `labeller()` now take `.rows` and `.cols` arguments. In addition, it also takes `.default`. `labeller()` is useful to customise how particular variables are labelled. The three additional arguments specify how to label the variables are not specifically mentioned, respectively for rows, columns or both. This makes it especially easy to set up a project-wide labeller dispatcher that can be reused across all your plots. See the documentation for an example."
ggplot2,NA,1,526,"The new labeller `label_context()` adapts to the number of factors facetted over. With a single factor, it displays only the values, just as before. But with multiple factors in a composite margin (e.g. with `~cyl + am`), the labels are passed over to `label_both()`. This way the variables names are displayed with the values to help identifying them."
ggplot2,NA,1,528,"Previously, a labeller function would take `variable` and `value` arguments and return a character vector. Now, they take a data frame of character vectors and return a list. The input data frame has one column per factor facetted over and each column in the returned list becomes one line in the strip label. See documentation for more details."
ggplot2,NA,1,529,"The labels received by a labeller now contain metadata: their margin (in the ""type"" attribute) and whether they come from a wrap or a grid facet (in the ""facet"" attribute)."
ggplot2,NA,1,530,Note that the new `as_labeller()` function operator provides an easy way to transform an existing function to a labeller function. The existing function just needs to take and return a character vector.
ggplot2,NA,1,531,"Improved documentation for `aes()`, `layer()` and much much more."
ggplot2,NA,1,532,I've tried to reduce the use of `...` so that you can see all the documentation in one place rather than having to integrate multiple pages. In some cases this has involved adding additional arguments to geoms to make it more clear what you can do:
ggplot2,532,2,533,"`geom_smooth()` gains explicit `method`, `se` and `formula` arguments."
ggplot2,532,2,534,"`geom_histogram()` gains `binwidth`, `bins`, `origin` and `right` arguments."
ggplot2,532,2,535,`geom_jitter()` gains `width` and `height` arguments to make it easier to control the amount of jittering without using the lengthy `position_jitter()` function (#1116)
ggplot2,NA,1,536,"Use of `qplot()` in examples has been minimised (#1123, @hrbrmstr). This is inline with the 2nd edition of the ggplot2 box, which minimises the use of `qplot()` in favour of `ggplot()`."
ggplot2,NA,1,537,"Tighly linked geoms and stats (e.g. `geom_boxplot()` and `stat_boxplot()`) are now documented in the same file so you can see all the arguments in one place. Variations of the same idea (e.g. `geom_path()`, `geom_line()`, and `geom_step()`) are also documented together."
ggplot2,NA,1,538,"It's now obvious that you can set the `binwidth` parameter for `stat_bin_hex()`, `stat_summary_hex()`, `stat_bin_2d()`, and `stat_summary_2d()`."
ggplot2,NA,1,539,"The internals of positions have been cleaned up considerably. You're unlikely to notice any external changes, although the documentation should be a little less confusing since positions now don't list parameters they never use."
ggplot2,NA,1,540,"All datasets have class `tbl_df` so if you also use dplyr, you get a better print method."
ggplot2,NA,1,541,`economics` has been brought up to date to 2015-04-01.
ggplot2,NA,1,542,New `economics_long` is the economics data in long form.
ggplot2,NA,1,543,"New `txhousing` dataset containing information about the Texas housing market. Useful for examples that need multiple time series, and for demonstrating model+vis methods."
ggplot2,NA,1,544,New `luv_colours` dataset which contains the locations of all built-in `colors()` in Luv space.
ggplot2,NA,1,545,"`movies` has been moved into its own package, ggplot2movies, because it was large and not terribly useful. If you've used the movies dataset, you'll now need to explicitly load the package with `library(ggplot2movies)`."
ggplot2,NA,1,546,"All partially matched arguments and `$` have been been replaced with full matches (@jimhester, #1134)."
ggplot2,NA,1,547,"ggplot2 now exports `alpha()` from the scales package (#1107), and `arrow()` and `unit()` from grid (#1225). This means you don't need attach scales/grid or do `scales::`/`grid::` for these commonly used functions."
ggplot2,NA,1,548,`aes_string()` now only parses character inputs. This fixes bugs when using it with numbers and non default `OutDec` settings (#1045).
ggplot2,NA,1,549,"`annotation_custom()` automatically adds a unique id to each grob name, making it easier to plot multiple grobs with the same name (e.g. grobs of ggplot2 graphics) in the same plot (#1256)."
ggplot2,NA,1,550,"`borders()` now accepts xlim and ylim arguments for specifying the geographical region of interest (@markpayneatwork, #1392)."
ggplot2,NA,1,551,`coord_cartesian()` applies the same expansion factor to limits as for scales. You can suppress with `expand = FALSE` (#1207).
ggplot2,NA,1,552,`coord_trans()` now works when breaks are suppressed (#1422).
ggplot2,NA,1,553,`cut_number()` gives error message if the number of requested bins can be created because there are two few unique values (#1046).
ggplot2,NA,1,554,Character labels in `facet_grid()` are no longer (incorrectly) coerced into factors. This caused problems with custom label functions (#1070).
ggplot2,NA,1,555,`facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` now allow you to use non-standard variable names by surrounding them with backticks (#1067).
ggplot2,NA,1,556,"`facet_wrap()` more carefully checks its `nrow` and `ncol` arguments to ensure that they're specified correctly (@richierocks, #962)"
ggplot2,NA,1,557,"`facet_wrap()` gains a `dir` argument to control the direction the panels are wrapped in. The default is ""h"" for horizontal. Use ""v"" for vertical layout (#1260)."
ggplot2,NA,1,558,"`geom_abline()`, `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` have been rewritten to have simpler behaviour and be more consistent:"
ggplot2,558,2,559,"`stat_abline()`, `stat_hline()` and `stat_vline()` have been removed: these were never suitable for use other than with `geom_abline()` etc and were not documented."
ggplot2,558,2,560,"`geom_abline()`, `geom_vline()` and `geom_hline()` are bound to `stat_identity()` and `position_identity()`"
ggplot2,558,2,561,Intercept parameters can no longer be set to a function.
ggplot2,558,2,562,"They are all documented in one file, since they are so closely related."
ggplot2,NA,1,563,"`geom_bin2d()` will now let you specify one dimension's breaks exactly, without touching the other dimension's default breaks at all (#1126)."
ggplot2,NA,1,564,`geom_crossbar()` sets grouping correctly so you can display multiple crossbars on one plot. It also makes the default `fatten` argument a little bigger to make the middle line more obvious (#1125).
ggplot2,NA,1,565,"`geom_histogram()` and `geom_smooth()` now only inform you about the default values once per layer, rather than once per panel (#1220)."
ggplot2,NA,1,566,`geom_pointrange()` gains `fatten` argument so you can control the size of the point relative to the size of the line.
ggplot2,NA,1,567,"`geom_segment()` annotations were not transforming with scales (@BrianDiggs, #859)."
ggplot2,NA,1,568,"`geom_smooth()` is no longer so chatty. If you want to know what the deafult smoothing method is, look it up in the documentation! (#1247)"
ggplot2,NA,1,569,`geom_violin()` now has the ability to draw quantile lines (@DanRuderman).
ggplot2,NA,1,570,"`ggplot()` now captures the parent frame to use for evaluation, rather than always defaulting to the global environment. This should make ggplot more suitable to use in more situations (e.g. with knitr)"
ggplot2,NA,1,571,"`ggsave()` has been simplified a little to make it easier to maintain. It no longer checks that you're printing a ggplot2 object (so now also works with any grid grob) (#970), and always requires a filename. Parameter `device` now supports character argument to specify which supported device to use ('pdf', 'png', 'jpeg', etc.), for when it cannot be correctly inferred from the file extension (for example when a temporary filename is supplied server side in shiny apps) (@sebkopf, #939). It no longer opens a graphics device if one isn't already open - this is annoying when you're running from a script (#1326)."
ggplot2,NA,1,572,"`guide_colorbar()` creates correct legend if only one color (@krlmlr, #943)."
ggplot2,NA,1,573,`guide_colorbar()` no longer fails when the legend is empty - previously this often masked misspecifications elsewhere in the plot (#967).
ggplot2,NA,1,574,New `layer_data()` function extracts the data used for plotting for a given layer. It's mostly useful for testing.
ggplot2,NA,1,575,"User supplied `minor_breaks` can now be supplied on the same scale as the data, and will be automatically transformed with by scale (#1385)."
ggplot2,NA,1,576,"You can now suppress the appearance of an axis/legend title (and the space that would allocated for it) with `NULL` in the `scale_` function. To use the default lable, use `waiver()` (#1145)."
ggplot2,NA,1,577,Position adjustments no longer warn about potentially varying ranges because the problem rarely occurs in practice and there are currently a lot of false positives since I don't understand exactly what FP criteria I should be testing.
ggplot2,NA,1,578,`scale_fill_grey()` now uses red for missing values. This matches `scale_colour_grey()` and makes it obvious where missing values lie. Override with `na.value`.
ggplot2,NA,1,579,`scale_*_gradient2()` defaults to using Lab colour space.
ggplot2,NA,1,580,`scale_*_gradientn()` now allows `colours` or `colors` (#1290)
ggplot2,NA,1,581,"`scale_y_continuous()` now also transforms the `lower`, `middle` and `upper` aesthetics used by `geom_boxplot()`: this only affects `geom_boxplot(stat = ""identity"")` (#1020)."
ggplot2,NA,1,582,Legends no longer inherit aesthetics if `inherit.aes` is FALSE (#1267).
ggplot2,NA,1,583,`lims()` makes it easy to set the limits of any axis (#1138).
ggplot2,NA,1,584,"`labels = NULL` now works with `guide_legend()` and `guide_colorbar()`. (#1175, #1183)."
ggplot2,NA,1,585,"`override.aes` now works with American aesthetic spelling, e.g. color"
ggplot2,NA,1,586,Scales no longer round data points to improve performance of colour palettes. Instead the scales package now uses a much faster colour interpolation algorithm (#1022).
ggplot2,NA,1,587,"`scale_*_brewer()` and `scale_*_distiller()` add new `direction` argument of `scales::brewer_pal`, making it easier to change the order of colours (@jiho, #1139)."
ggplot2,NA,1,588,`scale_x_date()` now clips dates outside the limits in the same way as `scale_x_continuous()` (#1090).
ggplot2,NA,1,589,"`stat_bin()` gains `bins` arguments, which denotes the number of bins. Now you can set `bins=100` instead of `binwidth=0.5`. Note that `breaks` or `binwidth` will override it (@tmshn, #1158, #102)."
ggplot2,NA,1,590,"`stat_boxplot()` warns if a continuous variable is used for the `x` aesthetic without also supplying a `group` aesthetic (#992, @krlmlr)."
ggplot2,NA,1,591,"`stat_summary_2d()` and `stat_bin_2d()` now share exactly the same code for determining breaks from `bins`, `binwidth`, and `origin`."
ggplot2,NA,1,592,`stat_summary_2d()` and `stat_bin_2d()` now output in tile/raster compatible form instead of rect compatible form.
ggplot2,NA,1,593,"Automatically computed breaks do not lead to an error for transformations like ""probit"" where the inverse can map to infinity (#871, @krlmlr)"
ggplot2,NA,1,594,"`stat_function()` now always evaluates the function on the original scale. Previously it computed the function on transformed scales, giving incorrect values (@BrianDiggs, #1011)."
ggplot2,NA,1,595,"`strip_dots` works with anonymous functions within calculated aesthetics (e.g. `aes(sapply(..density.., function(x) mean(x))))` (#1154, @NikNakk)"
ggplot2,NA,1,596,"`theme()` gains `validate = FALSE` parameter to turn off validation, and hence store arbitrary additional data in the themes. (@tdhock, #1121)"
ggplot2,NA,1,597,"Improved the calculation of segments needed to draw the curve representing a line when plotted in polar coordinates. In some cases, the last segment of a multi-segment line was not drawn (@BrianDiggs, #952)"

googledrive,NA,1,12,"`shortcut_resolve()`: resolves a shortcut to its target, i.e. the file it refers to. Works for multiple files at once, i.e. the input can be a mix of shortcuts and non-shortcuts. The non-shortcuts are passed through and the shortcuts are replaced by their targets."
googledrive,NA,1,14,"Main principle: shortcuts are first-class Drive files that we assume users will need to manipulate with googledrive. In general, there is no automatic resolution to the target file."
googledrive,NA,1,15,"`drive_reveal(what = ""path"")` returns the canonical path, i.e. there will be no shortcuts among the non-terminal ""folder"" parts of the returned path."
googledrive,NA,1,16,"`drive_get(path = ""foo/"")` can retrieve a folder named ""foo"" or a shortcut named ""foo"", whose target is a folder."
googledrive,NA,1,17,"When a shortcut-to-a-folder is specified as the `path`, in a context where it unambiguously specifies a parent folder, the `path` **is** auto-resolved to its target folder. This is the exception to the ""no automatic resolution"" rule. Functions affected:"

googledrive,NA,1,37,"`drive_reveal(what = ""property_name"")` now works for any property found in the file metadata stored in the `drive_resource` column. The new column is also simplified in more cases now, e.g. to `character` or `logical`. If the `property_name` suggests it's a date-time, we return `POSIXct`."
googledrive,NA,1,38,"We've modernized the mechanisms by which the `dribble` class is (or is not) retained by various data frame operations. This boils down to updating or adding methods used by the base, dplyr, pillar/tibble, and vctrs packages."
googledrive,NA,1,39,"We focus on compatibility with dplyr \>= 1.0.0, which was released a year ago. googledrive only Suggests dplyr, so all this really means is that `dribble` manipulation via dplyr now works best with dplyr \>= 1.0.0."
googledrive,NA,1,40,"The `drive_id` S3 class is now implemented more fully, using the vctrs package (#93, #364):"

googledrive,NA,1,84,`generate_request()` has been renamed to `request_generate()`.
googledrive,NA,1,85,`make_request()` had been renamed to `request_make()` and is a very thin wrapper around `gargle::request_make()` that only adds googledrive's user agent.

haven,NA,1,4,@gorcha is now a haven author in recognition of his significant and sustained contributions.
haven,NA,1,5,All `write_` functions can now write custom variable widths by setting the `width` attribute (#650).
haven,NA,1,6,"When writing files, the minimum width for character variables is now 1. This fixes issues with statistical software reading blank character variables with width 0 (#650)."
haven,NA,1,7,"`write_dta()` now uses strL when strings are too long to be stored in an str# variable (#437). strL is used when strings are longer than 2045 characters by default, which matches Stata's behaviour, but this can be reduced with the `strl_threshold` argument."
haven,NA,1,8,"`write_xpt()` can now write dataset labels with the `label` argument, which defaults to the `label` attribute of the input data frame, if present (#562)."

haven,NA,1,14,Updated to ReadStat 1.1.8 RC.
haven,14,2,15,Fix bug when writing formats to XPT files (#650).
haven,14,2,16,Fix off by one error in indexing for strL variables (#437).
haven,NA,1,17,`labelled()` vectors now throw a warning when combining two vectors with conflicting labels (#667).
haven,NA,1,18,`zap_labels()` gains a `user_na` argument to control whether user-defined missing values are converted to `NA` or left as is (#638).
haven,NA,1,19,vctrs casting and coercion generics now do less work when working with two identical `labelled()` vectors. This significantly improves performance when working with `labelled()` vectors in grouped data frames (#658).
haven,NA,1,20,Errors and warnings now use `cli_abort()` and `cli_warning()` (#661).
haven,NA,1,21,"R 3.4 is now the minimum supported version, in line with [tidyverse policy](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/)."

haven,NA,1,31,"`labelled_spss()` gains full vctrs support thanks to the hard work of @gorcha (#527, #534, #538, #557). This means that they should now work seamlessly in dplyr 1.0.0, tidyr 1.0.0 and other packages that use vctrs."
haven,NA,1,32,"`labelled()` vectors are more permissive when concatenating; output labels will be a combination of the left-hand and the right-hand side, preferring values assigned to the left-hand side (#543)."
haven,NA,1,33,"Date-times are no longer forced to UTC, but instead converted to the equivalent UTC (#555). This should ensure that you see the same date-time in R and in Stata/SPSS/SAS."

haven,NA,1,35,"`as_factor(levels = ""values"")` preserves values of unlabelled elements (#570)."
haven,NA,1,36,"`labelled_spss()` is a little stricter: it prevents `na_range` and `na_value` from containing missing values, and ensures that `na_range` is in the correct order (#574)."
haven,NA,1,37,`read_spss()` now reads NA values and ranges of character variables (#409).
haven,NA,1,38,`write_dta()` now correctly writes tagged NAs (including tagged NAs in labels) (#583) and once again validates length of variables names (#485).
haven,NA,1,39,"`write_*()` now validate file and variable metadata with ReadStat. This should prevent many invalid files from being written (#408). Additionally, validation failures now provide more details about the source of the problem (e.g. the column name of the problem) (#463)."
haven,NA,1,40,"`write_sav(compress = FALSE)` now uses SPSS bytecode compression instead of the rarely-used uncompressed mode. `compress = TRUE` continues to use the newer (and not universally supported, but more compact) zlib format (@oliverbock, #544)."
haven,NA,1,41,"Add missing methods so `median()`, `quantile()` and `summary()` work once more (#520)."
haven,NA,1,42,Add missing cast methods (#522).
haven,NA,1,43,"`labelled()` gains the necessary support to work seemlessly in dplyr 1.0.0, tidyr 1.0.0, and other packages that use vctrs (@mikmart, #496)."
haven,NA,1,44,"`labelled()` vectors now explicitly inherit from the corresponding base types (e.g. integer, double, or character) (#509)."
haven,NA,1,45,"ReadStat update, including `read_sas()` supports for ""any"" encoding (#482), and fixes for compiler warnings."

haven,NA,1,54,All `write_` functions can now write labelled vectors with `NULL` labels (#442).
haven,NA,1,55,"`write_dta()` can now write dataset labels with the `label` argument, which defaults to the `label` attribute of the input data frame, if present (@gorcha, #449)."
haven,NA,1,56,"`write_dta()` works better with Stata 15, thanks to updated ReadStat (#461)"
haven,NA,1,57,Fixes for R CMD check
haven,NA,1,61,`as_factor()`:

haven,NA,1,75,"`labelled()` and `labelled_spss()` now produce objects with class ""haven_labelled"" and ""haven_labelled_spss"". Previously, the ""labelled"" class name clashed with the labelled class defined by Hmisc (#329)."
haven,NA,1,76,"Unfortunately I couldn't come up with a way to fix this problem except to change the class name; it seems reasonable that haven should be the one to change names given that Hmisc has been around much longer. This will require some changes to packages that use haven, but shouldn't affect user code."
haven,NA,1,77,"`labelled()` and `labelled_spss()` now support adding the `label` attribute to the resulting object. The `label` is a short, human-readable description of the object, and is now also used when printing, and can be easily removed using the new `zap_label()` function. (#362, @huftis)"

haven,122,2,124,Support extended ASCII encoding for Stata (#71).
haven,122,2,125,"Support for Stata 14 files (#75, #212)."

haven,122,2,127,More likely to get an error when attempting to create an invalid output file (#171).
haven,NA,1,128,"Added support for reading and writing variable formats. Similarly to to variable labels, formats are stored as an attribute on the vector. Use `zap_formats()` if you want to remove these attributes. (@gorcha, #119, #123)."
haven,NA,1,129,"Added support for reading file ""label"" and ""notes"". These are not currently printed, but are stored in the attributes if you need to access them (#186)."
haven,NA,1,130,"Added support for ""tagged"" missing values (in Stata these are called ""extended"" and in SAS these are called ""special"") which carry an extra byte of information: a character label from ""a"" to ""z"". The downside of this change is that all integer columns are now converted to doubles, to support the encoding of the tag in the payload of a NaN."

These can either be a set of distinct values, or for numeric vectors, a range. `zap_labels()` strips labels, and replaces user-defined missing values with `NA`. New `zap_missing()` just replaces user-defined missing values with `NA`."
haven,NA,1,132,"`labelled_spss()` is potentially dangerous to work with in R because base functions don't know about `labelled_spss()` functions so will return the wrong result in the presence of user-defined missing values.

httr,NA,1,171,"OAuth tokens are cached locally in a file called `.httr-oauth` (unless you opt out).

httr,NA,1,193,export `hmac_sha1` since so many authentication protocols need this
httr,NA,1,194,"`content` will automatically guess what type of output (parsed, text or raw) based on the content-type header. It also automatically converts text content to UTF-8 (using the charset in the media type) and can guess at mime type from extension if server doesn't supply one. Media type and encoding can be overridden with the `type` and `encoding` arguments respectively."
httr,NA,1,195,response objects automatically print content type to aid debugging.
httr,NA,1,196,"`text_content` has become `context(, ""text"")` and `parsed_content` `content(, ""parsed"")`. The previous calls are deprecated and will be removed in a future version."

lubridate,NA,1,272,"arithmetic operations will no longer perform implicit class changes between timespans. Users must explicitly state how and when they wish class changes to occur with as.period(), as.duration(), and as.interval(). This makes code written with lubridate more robust, as such implicit changes often did not produce consistent behavior across a variety of operations. It also allows lubridate to be less chatty with fewer console messages. lubridate does not need to explain what it is doing, because it no longer attempts to do things whose outcome would not be clear. On the other hand, arithmetic between multiple time classes will produce informative error messages."
lubridate,NA,1,273,the internal structure of lubridate R code has been reorganized at https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate to make lubridate more development friendly.

Intervals can be created with %--%; modified with int_shift(), int_flip(), and int_standardize(); manipulated with intersect(), union(), and setdiff(); and used in logical tests with int_aligns(), int_overlaps(), and %within%. lubridate will no longer perform arithmetic between two intervals because the correct results of such operations is no more obvious than the correct result of adding two dates. Instead users are encouraged to use the new set operations or to directly modify intervals with int_start() and int_end(), which can also be used as settors. lubridate now supports negative intervals as well as positive intervals. Intervals also now display with a time zone."

purrr,NA,1,1,`cross()` and all its variants have been deprecated in favour of `tidyr::expand_grid()`. These functions were slow and buggy and we no longer think they are the right approach to solving this problem. See #768 for more information.
purrr,NA,1,2,"`update_list()` (#858) and `rerun()` (#877), and the use of tidyselect with `map_at()` and friends (#874) have been deprecated. These functions use some form of non-standard evaluation which we now believe is a poor fit for purrr."
purrr,NA,1,3,The `lift_*` family of functions has been superseded. We no longer believe these to be a good fit for purrr because they rely on a style of function manipulation that is very uncommon in R code (#871).

purrr,NA,1,11,"`as_function()`, `at_depth()`, and the `...f` argument to `partial()` are no longer supported. They have been defunct for quite some time."
purrr,NA,1,12,"Soft deprecated functions: `%@%`, `reduce_right()`, `reduce2_right()`, `accumulate_right()` are now fully deprecated. Similarly, the `.lazy`, `.env`, and `.first` arguments to `partial()`, and the `.right` argument to `detect()` and `detect_index()` are fully deprecated. Removing elements with `NULL` in `list_modify()` and `list_merge()` is now fully deprecated."
purrr,NA,1,13,`is_numeric()` and `is_scalar_numeric()` have been removed. They have been deprecated since purrr 0.2.3 (Sep 2017).
purrr,NA,1,14,"`invoke_*()` is now deprecated. It was superseded in 0.3.0 (Jan 2019) and 3.5 years later, we have decided to deprecate it as part of the API refinement in the 1.0.0 release."
purrr,NA,1,15,`map_call()` has been removed. It was made defunct in 0.3.0.
purrr,NA,1,16,`*_at()` can now take a function (or formula) that's passed the vector of element names and returns the elements to select.
purrr,NA,1,17,"New `map_vec()`, `map2_vec()`, and `pmap_vec()` work on all types of vectors, extending `map_lgl()`, `map_int()`, and friends so that you can easily work with dates, factors, date-times and more (#435)."
purrr,NA,1,18,New `keep_at()` and `discard_at()` that work like `keep()` and `discard()` but operation on element names rather than element contents (#817).
purrr,NA,1,19,Some mapping functions have now a `.progress` argument to create a progress bar. See `?progress_bars` (#149).
purrr,NA,1,20,purrr is now licensed as MIT (#805).
purrr,NA,1,21,"`modify()`, `modify_if()`, `modify_at()`, and `modify2()` are no longer generics. We have discovered a simple implementation that no longer requires genericity and methods were only provided by a very small number of packages (#894)."
purrr,NA,1,22,"purrr now uses the base pipe (`|>`) and anonymous function short hand (`\(x)`), in all examples. This means that examples will no longer work in R 4.0 and earlier so in those versions of R, the examples are automatically converted to a regular section with a note that they might not work (#936)."
purrr,NA,1,23,New `modify_tree()` for recursively modifying nested data structures (#720).
purrr,NA,1,24,"New `list_c()`, `list_rbind()`, and `list_cbind()` make it easy to `c()`, `rbind()`, or `cbind()` all of the elements in a list."
purrr,NA,1,25,New `list_simplify()` reduces a list of length-1 vectors to a simpler atomic or S3 vector (#900).
purrr,NA,1,26,New `list_transpose()` which automatically simplifies if possible (#875).
purrr,NA,1,27,"`accumulate()` and `accumulate2()` now both simplify the output if possible using vctrs. New arguments `simplify` and `ptype` allow you to control the details of simplification (#774, #809)."
purrr,NA,1,28,"`_lgl()`, `_int()`, `_int()`, and `_dbl()` now use the same (strict) coercion methods as vctrs (#904). This means that:"
purrr,28,2,29,"`map_chr(TRUE, identity)`, `map_chr(0L, identity)`, and `map_chr(1L, identity)` are deprecated because we now believe that converting a logical/integer/double to a character vector should require an explicit coercion."
purrr,28,2,30,"`map_int(1.5, identity)` now fails because we believe that silently truncating doubles to integers is dangerous. But note that `map_int(1, identity)` still works since no numeric precision is lost."
purrr,28,2,31,"`map_int(c(TRUE, FALSE), identity)`, `map_dbl(c(TRUE, FALSE), identity)`, `map_lgl(c(1L, 0L), identity)` and `map_lgl(c(1, 0), identity)` now succeed because 1/TRUE and 0/FALSE should be interchangeable."
purrr,NA,1,32,"`map2()`, `modify2()`, and `pmap()` now use tidyverse recycling rules where vectors of length 1 are recycled to any size but all others must have the same length (#878)."
purrr,NA,1,33,`map2()` and `pmap()` now recycle names of their first input if needed (#783).
purrr,NA,1,34,"`modify()`, `modify_if()`, and `modify_at()` have been reimplemented using vctrs principles. This shouldn't have an user facing impact, but it does make the implementation much simpler."
purrr,NA,1,35,`vec_depth()` is now `pluck_depth()` and works with more types of input (#818).
purrr,NA,1,36,`pluck()` now requires indices to be length 1 (#813). It also now reports the correct type if you supply an unexpected index.
purrr,NA,1,37,"`pluck()` now accepts negative integers, indexing from the right (#603)."
purrr,NA,1,38,`pluck()` and `chuck()` now fail if you provide named inputs to ... (#788).
purrr,NA,1,39,`pluck()` no longer replaces 0-length vectors with `default`; it now only applies absent and `NULL` components.
purrr,NA,1,40,`pluck<-`/`assign_in()` can now modify non-existing locations (#704).
purrr,NA,1,41,`pluck<-`/`assign_in()` now sets elements to `NULL` rather than removing them (#636). Now use the explicit `zap()` if you want to remove elements.
purrr,NA,1,42,"`modify()`, `modify2()`, and `modify_if()` now correctly handle `NULL`s in replacement values (#655, #746, #753)."
purrr,NA,1,43,`list_modify()`'s interface has been standardised. Modifying with `NULL` now always creates a `NULL` in the output (#810)
purrr,NA,1,44,New `list_update()` which is similar to `list_modify()` but doesn't work recursively (#822).
purrr,NA,1,45,`list_modify()` no longer recurses into data frames (and other objects built on top of lists that are fundamentally non-list like) (#810).
purrr,NA,1,46,`modify()` no longer supports modifying calls or pairlists.
purrr,NA,1,47,`modify_depth()` is no longer a generic. This makes it more consistent with `map_depth()`.
purrr,NA,1,48,"`map_depth()` now uses `is.list()` to determine if there's more depth to recurse into, as opposed to `!is_atomic(.x)` (#920)."
purrr,NA,1,49,"`as_mapper()` is now around twice as fast when used with character, integer, or list (#820)."
purrr,NA,1,50,`possibly()` now defaults `otherwise` to NULL.
purrr,NA,1,51,"`modify_if(.else)` is now actually evaluated for atomic vectors (@mgirlich, #701)."
purrr,NA,1,52,"`lmap()` now always returns a list, even if `.x` is a data frame. This makes it more consistent with other functions in the `map` family."
purrr,NA,1,53,`lmap_if()` correctly handles `.else` functions (#847).
purrr,NA,1,54,"`every()` now correctly propagates missing values using the same rules as `&&` (#751). Internally, it has become a wrapper around `&&`. This makes it consistent with `&&` and also with `some()` which has always been a wrapper around `||` with the same propagation rules."
purrr,NA,1,55,"`every()` and `some()` now properly check the return value of their predicate function. It must now return a `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`."
purrr,NA,1,56,Greatly improved performance of functions created with `partial()` (#715). Their invocation is now as fast as for functions creating manually.
purrr,NA,1,57,`partial()` no longer inlines the function in the call stack. This fixes issues when `partial()` is used with `lm()` for instance (#707).
purrr,NA,1,58,"Fixed issue in `list_modify()` that prevented lists from being removed with `zap()` (@adamroyjones, #777)."
purrr,NA,1,59,"Added documentation for exporting functions created with purrr adverb (@njtierney, #668). See `?faq-adverbs-export`."
purrr,NA,1,60,"Added `none()`, which tests that a predicate is false for all elements (the opposite of `every()`) (@AliciaSchep, #735)."
purrr,NA,1,61,Maintenance release.
purrr,NA,1,62,"The documentation of `map()` and its variants has been improved by @surdina as part of the Tidyverse Developer Day (@surdina, #671)."
purrr,NA,1,63,purrr now depends on R 3.2 or greater.
purrr,NA,1,64,Fix protection issues reported by rchk.
purrr,NA,1,65,`reduce()` now forces arguments (#643).
purrr,NA,1,66,Fixed an issue in `partial()` with generic functions (#647).
purrr,NA,1,67,`negate()` now works with generic functions and functions with early returns.
purrr,NA,1,68,"`compose()` now works with generic functions again (#629, #639). Its set of unit tests was expanded to cover many edge cases."
purrr,NA,1,69,"`prepend()` now works with empty lists (@czeildi, #637)"
purrr,NA,1,70,`modify()` and variants are now wrapping `[[<-` instead of `[<-`. This change increases the genericity of these functions but might cause different behaviour in some cases.
purrr,NA,1,71,"For instance, the `[[<-` for data frames is stricter than the `[<-` method and might throw errors instead of warnings. This is the case when assigning a longer vector than the number of rows. `[<-` truncates the vector with a warning, `[[<-` fails with an error (as is appropriate)."
purrr,NA,1,72,`modify()` and variants now return the same type as the input when the input is an atomic vector.
purrr,NA,1,73,"All functionals taking predicate functions (like `keep()`, `detect()`, `some()`) got stricter. Predicate functions must now return a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`."
purrr,NA,1,74,This change is meant to detect problems early with a more meaningful error message.
purrr,NA,1,75,"New `chuck()` function. This is a strict variant of `pluck()` that throws errors when an element does not exist instead of returning `NULL` (@daniel-barnett, #482)."
purrr,NA,1,76,New `assign_in()` and `pluck<-` functions. They modify a data structure at an existing pluck location.
purrr,NA,1,77,New `modify_in()` function to map a function at a pluck location.
purrr,NA,1,78,`pluck()` now dispatches properly with S3 vectors. The vector class must implement a `length()` method for numeric indexing and a `names()` method for string indexing.
purrr,NA,1,79,`pluck()` now supports primitive functions (#404).
purrr,NA,1,80,New `.else` argument for `map_if()` and `modify_if()`. They take an alternative function that is mapped over elements of the input for which the predicate function returns `FALSE` (#324).
purrr,NA,1,81,"`reduce()`, `reduce2()`, `accumulate()`, and `accumulate2()` now terminate early when the function returns a value wrapped with `done()` (#253). When an empty `done()` is returned, the value at the last iteration is returned instead."
purrr,NA,1,82,"Functions taking predicates (`map_if()`, `keep()`, `some()`, `every()`, `keep()`, etc) now fail with an informative message when the return value is not `TRUE` or `FALSE` (#470)."
purrr,NA,1,83,"This is a breaking change for `every()` and `some()` which were documented to be more liberal in the values they accepted as logical (any vector was considered `TRUE` if not a single `FALSE` value, no matter its length). These functions signal soft-deprecation warnings instead of a hard failure."
purrr,NA,1,84,"Edit (purr 0.4.0): `every()` and `some()` never issued deprecation warnings because of a technical issue. We didn't fix the warnings in the end, and using predicates returning `NA` is no longer considered deprecated. If you need to use `every()` and `some()` in contexts where `NA` propagation is unsafe, e.g. in `if ()` conditions, make sure to use safe predicate functions like `is_true()`."
purrr,NA,1,85,"`modify()` and variants are now implemented using `length()`, `[[`, and `[[<-` methods. This implementation should be compatible with most vector classes."
purrr,NA,1,86,New `modify2()` and `imodify()` functions. These work like `map()` and `imap()` but preserve the type of `.x` in the return value.
purrr,NA,1,87,"`pmap()` and `pwalk()` now preserve class for inputs of `factor`, `Date`, `POSIXct` and other atomic S3 classes with an appropriate `[[` method (#358, @mikmart)."
purrr,NA,1,88,"`modify()`, `modify_if()` and `modify_at()` now preserve the class of atomic vectors instead of promoting them to lists. New S3 methods are provided for character, logical, double, and integer classes (@t-kalinowski, #417)."
purrr,NA,1,89,"By popular request, `at_depth()` has been brought back as `map_depth()`. Like `modify_depth()`, it applies a function at a specified level of a data structure. However, it transforms all traversed vectors up to `.depth` to bare lists (#381)."
purrr,NA,1,90,"`map_at()`, `modify_at()` and `lmap_at()` accept negative values for `.at`, ignoring elements at those positions."
purrr,NA,1,91,`map()` and `modify()` now work with calls and pairlists (#412).
purrr,NA,1,92,"`modify_depth()` now modifies atomic leaves as well. This makes `modify_depth(x, 1, fn)` equivalent to `modify(x, fn)` (#359)."
purrr,NA,1,93,New `accumulate2()` function which is to `accumulate()` what `reduce2()` is to `reduce()`.
purrr,NA,1,94,"New `rate_backoff()` and `rate_delay()` functions to create rate objects. You can pass rates to `insistently()`, `slowly()`, or the lower level function `rate_sleep()`. This will cause a function to wait for a given amount of time with exponential backoff (increasingly larger waiting times) or for a constant delay."
purrr,NA,1,95,"`insistently(f)` modifies a function, `f`, so that it is repeatedly called until it succeeds (@richierocks, @ijlyttle)."
purrr,NA,1,96,`slowly()` modifies a function so that it waits for a given amount of time between calls.
purrr,NA,1,98,"`partial()` now supports empty `... =` argument to specify the position of future arguments, relative to partialised ones. This syntax is borrowed from (and implemented with) `rlang::call_modify()`."
purrr,NA,1,99,"To prevent partial matching of `...` on `...f`, the latter has been renamed to `.f`, which is more consistent with other purrr function signatures."
purrr,NA,1,100,"`partial()` now supports quasiquotation. When you unquote an argument, it is evaluated only once at function creation time. This is more flexible than the `.lazy` argument since you can control the timing of evaluation for each argument. Consequently, `.lazy` is soft-deprecated (#457)."
purrr,NA,1,101,Fixed an infinite loop when partialised function is given the same name as the original function (#387).
purrr,NA,1,102,`partial()` now calls `as_closure()` on primitive functions to ensure argument matching (#360).
purrr,NA,1,103,The `.lazy` argument of `partial()` is soft-deprecated in favour of quasiquotation:
purrr,NA,1,104,The tibble package is now in Suggests rather than Imports. This brings the hard dependency of purrr to just rlang and magrittr.
purrr,NA,1,105,`compose()` now returns an identity function when called without inputs.
purrr,NA,1,106,"Functions created with `compose()` now have the same formal parameters as the first function to be called. They also feature a more informative print method that prints all composed functions in turn (@egnha, #366)."
purrr,NA,1,107,"New `.dir` argument in `compose()`. When set to `""forward""`, the functions are composed from left to right rather than right to left."
purrr,NA,1,108,"`list_modify()` now supports the `zap()` sentinel (reexported from rlang) to remove elements from lists. Consequently, removing elements with the ambiguous sentinel `NULL` is soft-deprecated."
purrr,NA,1,109,"The requirements of `list_modify()` and `list_merge()` have been relaxed. Previously it required both the modified lists and the inputs to be either named or unnamed. This restriction now only applies to inputs in `...`. When inputs are all named, they are matched to the list by name. When they are all unnamed, they are matched positionally. Otherwise, this is an error."
purrr,NA,1,110,Fixed ordering of names returned by `accumulate_right()` output. They now correspond to the order of inputs.
purrr,NA,1,111,Fixed names of `accumulate()` output when `.init` is supplied.
purrr,NA,1,112,"`compose()` now supports composition with lambdas (@ColinFay, #556)"
purrr,NA,1,113,Fixed a `pmap()` crash with empty lists on the Win32 platform (#565).
purrr,NA,1,114,"`modify_depth` now has `.ragged` argument evaluates correctly to `TRUE` by default when `.depth < 0` (@cderv, #530)."
purrr,NA,1,115,"`accumulate()` now inherits names from their first input (@AshesITR, #446)."
purrr,NA,1,116,"`attr_getter()` no longer uses partial matching. For example, if an `x` object has a `labels` attribute but no `label` attribute, `attr_getter(""label"")(x)` will no longer extract the `labels` attribute (#460, @huftis)."
purrr,NA,1,117,`flatten_dfr()` and `flatten_dfc()` now aborts if dplyr is not installed. (#454)
purrr,NA,1,118,`imap_dfr()` now works with `.id` argument is provided (#429)
purrr,NA,1,119,"`list_modify()`, `update_list()` and `list_merge()` now handle duplicate duplicate argument names correctly (#441, @mgirlich)."
purrr,NA,1,120,"`map_raw`, `imap_raw`, `flatten_raw`, `invoke_map_raw`, `map2_raw` and `pmap_raw` added to support raw vectors. (#455, @romainfrancois)"
purrr,NA,1,121,`flatten()` now supports raw and complex elements.
purrr,NA,1,122,"`array_branch()` and `array_tree()` now retain the `dimnames()` of the input array (#584, @flying-sheep)"
purrr,NA,1,123,`pluck()` no longer flattens lists of arguments. You can still do it manually with `!!!`. This change is for consistency with other dots-collecting functions of the tidyverse.
purrr,NA,1,124,"`map_at()`, `lmap_at()` and `modify_at()` now supports selection using `vars()` and `tidyselect` (@ColinFay, #608)."
purrr,NA,1,125,Note that for now you need to import `vars()` from dplyr or call it qualified like `dplyr::vars()`. It will be reexported from rlang in a future release.
purrr,NA,1,126,"`detect()` now has a .default argument to specify the value returned when nothing is detected (#622, @ColinFay)."
purrr,NA,1,128,`reduce_right()` is soft-deprecated and replaced by a new `.dir` argument of `reduce()`:
purrr,NA,1,129,"Note that the details of the computation have changed. Whereas `reduce_right()` computed `f(f(3, 2), 1)`, it now computes `f(1, f(2, 3))`. This is the standard way of reducing from the right."
purrr,NA,1,130,"To produce the exact same reduction as `reduce_right()`, simply reverse your vector and use a left reduction:"
purrr,NA,1,131,`reduce2_right()` is soft-deprecated without replacement. It is not clear what algorithmic properties should a right reduction have in this case. Please reach out if you know about a use case for a right reduction with a ternary function.
purrr,NA,1,132,"`accumulate_right()` is soft-deprecated and replaced by the new `.dir` argument of `accumulate()`. Note that the algorithm has slightly changed: the accumulated value is passed to the right rather than the left, which is consistent with a right reduction."
purrr,NA,1,133,The `.right` argument of `detect()` and `detect_index()` is soft-deprecated and renamed to `.dir` for consistency with other functions and clarity of the interface.
purrr,NA,1,135,The `.lazy` argument of `partial()` is soft-deprecated in favour of quasiquotation.
purrr,NA,1,136,We had to rename `...f` to `.f` in `partial()` in order to support `... =` argument (which would otherwise partial-match on `...f`). This also makes `partial()` more consistent with other purrr function signatures.
purrr,NA,1,138,"`invoke()` is retired in favour of the `exec()` function, reexported from rlang. `exec()` evaluates a function call built from its inputs and supports tidy dots:"
purrr,NA,1,139,Note that retired functions are not removed from the package and will be maintained undefinitely.
purrr,NA,1,140,"`invoke_map()` is retired without replacement because it is more complex to understand than the corresponding code using `map()`, `map2()` and `exec()`:"
purrr,NA,1,141,"`%@%` is soft-deprecated, please use the operator exported in rlang instead. The latter features an interface more consistent with `@` as it uses NSE, supports S4 fields, and has an assignment variant."
purrr,NA,1,142,Removing elements from lists using `NULL` in `list_modify()` is soft-deprecated. Please use the new `zap()` sentinel reexported from rlang instead:
purrr,NA,1,143,"This change is motivated by the ambiguity of `NULL` as a deletion sentinel because `NULL` is also a valid value in lists. In the future, `NULL` will set an element to `NULL` rather than removing the element."
purrr,NA,1,144,"`rerun()` is now in the questioning stage because we are no longer convinced NSE functions are a good fit for purrr. Also, `rerun(n, x)` can just as easily be expressed as `map(1:n, ~ x)` (with the added benefit of being passed the current index as argument to the lambda)."
purrr,NA,1,145,`map_call()` is defunct.
purrr,NA,1,146,This is a maintenance release following the release of dplyr 0.7.5.
purrr,NA,1,147,Fixes for R 3.1.
purrr,NA,1,149,"If `reduce()` fails with this message: `` Error: `.x` is empty, and no `.init` supplied ``, this is because `reduce()` now returns `.init` when `.x` is empty. Fix the problem by supplying an appropriate argument to `.init`, or by providing special behaviour when `.x` has length 0."
purrr,NA,1,150,"The type predicates have been migrated to rlang. Consequently the `bare-type-predicates` documentation topic is no longer in purrr, which might cause a warning if you cross-reference it."
purrr,NA,1,153,"`order_by()`, `sort_by()` and `split_by()` have been removed. `order_by()` conflicted with `dplyr::order_by()` and the complete family doesn't feel that useful. Use tibbles instead (#217)."
purrr,NA,1,154,`contains()` has been renamed to `has_element()` to avoid conflicts with dplyr (#217).
purrr,NA,1,157,"`as_function()` is now `as_mapper()` because it is a tranformation that makes sense primarily for mapping functions, not in general (#298). `.null` has been renamed to `.default` to better reflect its intent (#298). `.default` is returned whenever an element is absent or empty (#231, #254)."
purrr,NA,1,158,"`as_mapper()` sanitises primitive functions by transforming them to closures with standardised argument names (using `rlang::as_closure()`). For instance `+` is transformed to `function(.x, .y) .x + .y`. This results in proper argument matching so that `map(1:10, partial(`-`, .x = 5))` produces `list(5 - 1, 5 - 2, ...)`."
purrr,NA,1,159,"Recursive indexing can now extract objects out of environments (#213) and S4 objects (#200), as well as lists."
purrr,NA,1,160,"`attr_getter()` makes it possible to extract from attributes like `map(list(iris, mtcars), attr_getter(""row.names""))`."
purrr,NA,1,161,"The argument list for formula-functions has been tweaked so that you can refer to arguments by position with `..1`, `..2`, and so on. This makes it possible to use the formula shorthand for functions with more than two arguments (#289)."
purrr,NA,1,162,"`possibly()`, `safely()` and friends no longer capture interrupts: this means that you can now terminate a mapper using one of these with Escape or Ctrl + C (#314)"
purrr,NA,1,163,"All map functions now treat `NULL` the same way as an empty vector (#199), and return an empty vector if any input is an empty vector."
purrr,NA,1,164,All `map()` functions now force their arguments in the same way that base R does for `lapply()` (#191). This makes `map()` etc easier to use when generating functions.
purrr,NA,1,165,"A new family of ""indexed"" map functions, `imap()`, `imap_lgl()` etc, provide a short-hand for `map2(x, names(x))` or `map2(x, seq_along(x))` (#240)."
purrr,NA,1,166,The data frame suffix `_df` has been (soft) deprecated in favour of `_dfr` to more clearly indicate that it's a row-bind. All variants now also have a `_dfc` for column binding (#167). (These will not be terribly useful until `dplyr::bind_rows()`/`dplyr::bind_cols()` have better semantics for vectors.)
purrr,NA,1,169,`at_depth()` has been renamed to `modify_depth()`.
purrr,NA,1,170,"`modify_depth()` gains new `.ragged` argument, and negative depths are now computed relative to the deepest component of the list (#236)."
purrr,NA,1,171,`auto_browse(f)` returns a new function that automatically calls `browser()` if `f` throws an error (#281).
purrr,NA,1,172,`vec_depth()` computes the depth (i.e. the number of levels of indexing) or a vector (#243).
purrr,NA,1,173,"`reduce2()` and `reduce2_right()` make it possible to reduce with a 3 argument function where the first argument is the accumulated value, the second argument is `.x`, and the third argument is `.y` (#163)."
purrr,NA,1,174,`list_modify()` extends `stats::modifyList()` to replace by position if the list is not named.(#201). `list_merge()` operates similarly to `list_modify()` but combines instead of replacing (#322).
purrr,NA,1,175,The legacy function `update_list()` is basically a version of `list_modify` that evaluates formulas within the list. It is likely to be deprecated in the future in favour of a tidyeval interface such as a list method for `dplyr::mutate()`.
purrr,NA,1,176,"Thanks to @dchiu911, the unit test coverage of purrr is now much greater."
purrr,NA,1,177,All predicate functions are re-exported from rlang (#124).
purrr,NA,1,178,`compact()` now works with standard mapper conventions (#282).
purrr,NA,1,179,"`cross_n()` has been renamed to `cross()`. The `_n` suffix was removed for consistency with `pmap()` (originally called `map_n()` at the start of the project) and `transpose()` (originally called `zip_n()`). Similarly, `cross_d()` has been renamed to `cross_df()` for consistency with `map_df()`."
purrr,NA,1,180,`every()` and `some()` now return `NA` if present in the input (#174).
purrr,NA,1,181,`invoke()` uses a more robust approach to generate the argument list (#249) It no longer uses lazyeval to figure out which enviroment a character `f` comes from.
purrr,NA,1,182,`is_numeric()` and `is_scalar_numeric()` are deprecated because they don't test for what you might expect at first sight.
purrr,NA,1,183,`reduce()` now throws an error if `.x` is empty and `.init` is not supplied.
purrr,NA,1,184,"Deprecated functions `flatmap()`, `map3()`, `map_n()`, `walk3()`, `walk_n()`, `zip2()`, `zip3()`, `zip_n()` have been removed."
purrr,NA,1,185,`pmap()` coerces data frames to lists to avoid the expensive `[.data.frame` which provides security that is unneeded here (#220).
purrr,NA,1,186,`rdunif()` checks its inputs for validity (#211).
purrr,NA,1,187,"`set_names()` can now take a function to tranform the names programmatically (#276), and you can supply names in `...` to reduce typing even more more (#316). `set_names()` is now powered by `rlang::set_names()`."
purrr,NA,1,188,`safely()` now actually uses the `quiet` argument (#296).
purrr,NA,1,189,`transpose()` now matches by name if available (#164). You can override the default choice with the new `.names` argument.
purrr,NA,1,190,The function argument of `detect()` and `detect_index()` have been renamed from `.p` to `.f`. This is because they have mapper semantics rather than predicate semantics.
purrr,NA,1,192,"All data-frame based mappers have been removed in favour of new functions and idioms in the tidyverse. `dmap()`, `dmap_at()`, `dmap_if()`, `invoke_rows()`, `slice_rows()`, `map_rows()`, `by_slice()`, `by_row()`, and `unslice()` have been moved to purrrlyr. This is a bit of an aggresive change but it allows us to make the dependencies much lighter."
purrr,NA,1,193,Fix for dev tibble support.
purrr,NA,1,194,`as_function()` now supports list arguments which allow recursive indexing using either names or positions. They now always stop when encountering the first NULL (#173).
purrr,NA,1,195,`accumulate` and `reduce` correctly pass extra arguments to the worker function.
purrr,NA,1,196,"`as_function()` gains a `.null` argument that for character and numeric values allows you to specify what to return for null/absent elements (#110). This can be used with any map function, e.g. `map_int(x, 1, .null = NA)`"
purrr,NA,1,197,`as_function()` is now generic.
purrr,NA,1,198,New `is_function()` that returns `TRUE` only for regular functions.
purrr,NA,1,199,Fix crash on GCC triggered by `invoke_rows()`.
purrr,NA,1,200,There are two handy infix functions:
purrr,200,2,201,`x %||% y` is shorthand for `if (is.null(x)) y else x` (#109).
purrr,200,2,202,"`x %@% ""a""` is shorthand for `attr(x, ""a"", exact = TRUE)` (#69)."
purrr,NA,1,203,"`accumulate()` has been added to handle recursive folding. It is shortand for `Reduce(f, .x, accumulate = TRUE)` and follows a similar syntax to `reduce()` (#145). A right-hand version `accumulate_right()` was also added."
purrr,NA,1,204,`map_df()` row-binds output together. It's the equivalent of `plyr::ldply()` (#127)
purrr,NA,1,205,"`flatten()` is now type-stable and always returns a list. To return a simpler vector, use `flatten_lgl()`, `flatten_int()`, `flatten_dbl()`, `flatten_chr()`, or `flatten_df()`."
purrr,NA,1,206,"`invoke()` has been overhauled to be more useful: it now works similarly to `map_call()` when `.x` is NULL, and hence `map_call()` has been deprecated. `invoke_map()` is a vectorised complement to `invoke()` (#125), and comes with typed variants `invoke_map_lgl()`, `invoke_map_int()`, `invoke_map_dbl()`, `invoke_map_chr()`, and `invoke_map_df()`."
purrr,NA,1,207,"`transpose()` replaces `zip2()`, `zip3()`, and `zip_n()` (#128). The name more clearly reflects the intent (transposing the first and second levels of list). It no longer has fields argument or the `.simplify` argument; instead use the new `simplify_all()` function."
purrr,NA,1,208,"`safely()`, `quietly()`, and `possibly()` are experimental functions for working with functions with side-effects (e.g. printed output, messages, warnings, and errors) (#120). `safely()` is a version of `try()` that modifies a function (rather than an expression), and always returns a list with two components, `result` and `error`."
purrr,NA,1,209,`list_along()` and `rep_along()` generalise the idea of `seq_along()`. (#122).
purrr,NA,1,210,`is_null()` is the snake-case version of `is.null()`.
purrr,NA,1,211,"`pmap()` (parallel map) replaces `map_n()` (#132), and has typed-variants suffixed `pmap_lgl()`, `pmap_int()`, `pmap_dbl()`, `pmap_chr()`, and `pmap_df()`."
purrr,NA,1,212,"`set_names()` is a snake-case alternative to `setNames()` with stricter equality checking, and more convenient defaults for pipes: `x %>% set_names()` is equivalent to `setNames(x, x)` (#119)."
purrr,NA,1,214,"`map()` now always returns a list. Data frame support has been moved to `map_df()` and `dmap()`. The latter supports sliced data frames as a shortcut for the combination of `by_slice()` and `dmap()`: `x %>% by_slice(dmap, fun, .collate = ""rows"")`. The conditional variants `dmap_at()` and `dmap_if()` also support sliced data frames and will recycle scalar results to the slice size."
purrr,NA,1,215,"`map_rows()` has been renamed to `invoke_rows()`. As other rows-based functionals, it collates results inside lists by default, but with column collation this function is equivalent to `plyr::mdply()`."
purrr,NA,1,216,"The rows-based functionals gain a `.to` option to name the output column as well as a `.collate` argument. The latter allows to collate the output in lists (by default), on columns or on rows. This makes these functions more flexible and more predictable."
purrr,NA,1,217,"`as_function()`, which converts formulas etc to functions, is now exported (#123)."
purrr,NA,1,218,`rerun()` is correctly scoped (#95)
purrr,NA,1,219,`update_list()` can now modify an element called `x` (#98).
purrr,NA,1,220,"`map*()` now use custom C code, rather than relying on `lapply()`, `mapply()` etc. The performance characteristcs are very similar, but it allows us greater control over the output (#118)."
purrr,NA,1,221,"`map_lgl()` now has second argument `.f`, not `.p` (#134)."
purrr,NA,1,222,`flatmap()` -\> use `map()` followed by the appropriate `flatten()`.
purrr,NA,1,223,`map_call()` -\> `invoke()`.
purrr,NA,1,224,`map_n()` -\> `pmap()`; `walk_n()` -\> `pwalk()`.
purrr,NA,1,225,"`map3(x, y, z)` -\> `map_n(list(x, y, z))`; `walk3(x, y, z) ->`pwalk(list(x, y, z))\`"
readr,NA,1,1,"`read_table()`, `read_log()`, and `read_delim_chunked()` (and friends) gain the `show_col_types` argument found elsewhere. All `read_*()` functions now respect the `show_col_types` argument or option, even when using the first edition parsing engine (#1331)."
readr,NA,1,2,`show_progress()` uses `rlang::is_interactive()` instead of `base::interactive()` (#1356).
readr,NA,1,3,"`read_builtin()` does more argument checking, so that we catch obviously malformed input before passing along to `utils::data()` (#1361)."
readr,NA,1,4,`chickens.csv` and `whitespace-sample.txt` are new example datasets accessible via `readr_example()` (#1354).
readr,NA,1,5,Jenny Bryan is now the maintainer.
readr,NA,1,6,Fix buffer overflow when trying to parse an integer from a field that is over 64 characters long (#1326)
readr,NA,1,7,"All readr functions again read eagerly by default. Unfortunately many users experienced frustration from the drawbacks of lazy reading, in particular locking files on Windows, so it was decided to disable lazy reading default. However `options(readr.read_lazy = TRUE)` can be used to set the default to by lazy if desired."
readr,NA,1,8,New `readr.read_lazy` global option to control if readr reads files lazily or not (#1266)
readr,NA,1,9,"minor test tweak for compatibility with testthat 3.1.0 (#@lionel-, #1304)"
readr,NA,1,10,"`write_rds()` gains a `text=` argument, to control using a text based object representation, like the `ascii=` argument in `saveRDS()` (#1270)"
readr,NA,1,11,`options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)` now works as intended (#1250)
readr,NA,1,12,`read_delim_chunked()` now again correctly respects the `chunk_size` parameter (#1248)
readr,NA,1,13,"`type_convert()` gains a `guess_integer` argument, passed to `guess_parser()` (@jmbarbone, #1264)"
readr,NA,1,14,"`read_tsv()` now correctly passes the `quote` and `na` arguments to `vroom::vroom()` (#1254, #1255)"

readr,NA,1,21,"`with_edition(1, read_csv(""my_file.csv""))` will read `my_file.csv` with the first edition of readr."
readr,NA,1,22,`readr::local_edition(1)` placed at the top of your function or script will use the first edition for the rest of the function or script.
readr,NA,1,35,"`melt_csv()`, `melt_delim()`, `melt_tsv()` and `melt_fwf()` have been superseded by functions in the same name in the meltr package. The versions in readr have been deprecated. These functions rely on the first edition parsing code and would be challenging to update to the new parser. When the first edition parsing code is eventually removed from readr they will be removed."
readr,NA,1,36,"`read_table2()` has been renamed to `read_table()`, as most users expect `read_table()` to work like `utils::read.table()`. If you want the previous strict behavior of the `read_table()` you can use `read_fwf()` with `fwf_empty()` directly (#717)."
readr,NA,1,37,"Normalizing newlines in files with just carriage returns `\r` is no longer supported. The last major OS to use only CR as the newline was 'classic' Mac OS, which had its final release in 2001."
readr,NA,1,38,`read_*_chunked()` functions now include their specification as an attribute (#1143)
readr,NA,1,39,All `read_*()` functions gain a `col_select` argument to more easily choose which columns to select.
readr,NA,1,40,All `read_*()` functions gain a `id` argument to optionally store the file paths when reading multiple files.
readr,NA,1,41,All `read_*()` functions gain a `name_repair` argument to control how column names are repaired.

readr,NA,1,47,`read_table()` now handles skipped lines with unpaired quotes properly (#1180)
readr,NA,1,48,"The BH package is no longer a dependency. The boost C++ headers in BH have thousands of files, so can take a long time to extract and compiling them takes a great deal of memory, which made readr difficult to compile on systems with limited memory (#1147)."
readr,NA,1,49,"readr now uses the tzdb package when parsing date-times (@DavisVaughan, r-lib/vroom#273)"
readr,NA,1,50,Chunked readers now support files with more than `INT_MAX` (\~ 2 Billion) number of lines (#1177)

readxl,NA,1,8,"Cell location is determined more robustly in `.xlsx` files, guarding against the idiosyncratic way in which certain 3rd party tools include (or, rather, do not include) cell location in individual cell nodes (#648, #671)."
readxl,NA,1,9,"Warning messages for impossible dates are more specific. Unsupported dates prior to 1900 have their own message now, instead of being lumped in with dates on the non-existent day of February 29, 1900 (#551, #554, @cderv)."
readxl,NA,1,10,readxl is now licensed as MIT (#632).
readxl,NA,1,11,"readxl now states its support for R \>= 3.4 explicitly. Why 3.4? Because the [tidyverse policy](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/) is to support the current version, the devel version, and four previous versions of R. It was necessary to introduce a minimum R version, in order to state a minimum version for a package listed in `LinkingTo`."
readxl,NA,1,12,readxl embeds libxls v1.6.2 (the previous release embedded v1.5.0). The libxls project is hosted at <https://github.com/libxls/libxls> and you can learn more about the cumulative changes in its release notes:

readxl,NA,1,19,"readxl has switched from Rcpp to cpp11 and now requires C++11 (#659, @sbearrows)."
readxl,NA,1,20,"The minimum version of tibble has been bumped to 2.0.1 (released 2019-01-12), completing the transition to an approach to column name repair used across the tidyverse."

readxl,NA,1,26,[Column Names](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/column-names.html) is a new article about this feature.
readxl,NA,1,27,"readxl delegates name repair to tibble, therefore the installed tibble version determines how names are repaired."
readxl,NA,1,28,"If tibble \>= v2.0.0, the full power of `.name_repair` is available, defaulting to `.name_repair = ""unique""`. Otherwise, the legacy function `tibble::repair_names(prefix = ""X"", sep = ""__"")` is used, replicating the behaviour of readxl v1.1.0."

readxl,NA,1,33,"Once per session, readxl emits a message stating that it works best with tibble \>= v2.0.0. It is anticipated that this will become a hard minimum version requirement in a future version of readxl."
readxl,NA,1,34,"`read_excel()` and friends gain a `progress` argument that controls a progress spinner (#243, #538)."
readxl,NA,1,35,`read_xls()` and `read_xlsx()` pass the `trim_ws` argument along (#514).
readxl,NA,1,36,"readxl has a [new article](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/multiple-header-rows.html) on reading Excel files with multiple header rows (#486, #492 @apreshill)."

readxl,NA,1,41,"`read_excel()` and `excel_sheets()` associate a larger set of file extensions with xlsx and are better able to guess the format of a file with a nonstandard or missing extension. This is about deciding whether to treat a file as xls or xlsx. (#342, #411, #457)"
readxl,41,2,42,`excel_format()` is the newly-exported format-guessing function.
readxl,41,2,43,"`format_from_ext()` is a low-level helper, also exported, that only consults file extension. In addition to the obvious interpretation of `.xls` and `.xlsx`, the extensions `.xlsm`, `.xltx`, and `.xltm` are now associated with xlsx."
readxl,41,2,44,"`format_from_signature()` is a low-level helper, also exported, that consults the file's signature (a.k.a. magic number). It's handy for files that lack an extension."
readxl,NA,1,45,"Embedded libxls has been updated to address security vulnerabilitities identified in late 2017 (#441, #442)."

These have been addressed in libxls and the embedded version of libxls incorporates those fixes."
readxl,45,2,47,"Although [CVE-2017-12111](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0463) and [CVE-2017-2919](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0426) mention readxl, the notices clarify that these CVEs do not actually affect readxl. Both have been fixed in libxls for quite a while: CVE-2017-12111 since 2014 and CVE-2017-2919 since 2012."
readxl,NA,1,48,"xlsx structured as a ""minimal conformant SpreadsheetML package"" can be read. Most obvious feature of such sheets is the lack of an `xl/` directory in the unzipped form. (xlsx, #435, #437)"

readxl,NA,1,65,"`""list""` is a new accepted value for `col_types`. Loads data as a list of length-1 vectors, that are typed using the logic from `col_types = NULL`, but on a cell-by-cell basis (#262 @gergness)."
readxl,NA,1,66,"`""logical""` is a new accepted value for `col_types`. When `col_types = NULL`, it is the guessed type for cells Excel advertises as Boolean. When a column has no data, it is now filled with logical `NA`. (#277, #270)"

reprex,NA,1,2,"The ad placed by `reprex(advertise = TRUE)` has been tweaked for `venue = ""gh""` (and, therefore, for its aliases `""so""` and `""ds""`) and `venue = ""slack""` (#395)."
reprex,NA,1,3,"reprex takes advantage of rlang 1.0.0's improved [support for backtraces in knitted documents](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/rlang_backtrace_on_error.html#errors-in-rmarkdown) and sets the option `rlang_backtrace_on_error_report = ""full""` (#377)."
reprex,NA,1,4,"`reprex_rtf()` (a shortcut for `reprex(venue = ""rtf"")`) now works on Windows, even if one of the (possibly temporary) filepaths contains a space, e.g. because the username contains a space (#409, @cderv)."
reprex,NA,1,5,"The RStudio addin no longer displays a warning about condition length when selecting 'current file' as the reprex source (#391, @bisaloo)."
reprex,NA,1,6,Internal matters:
reprex,6,2,7,"Help files below `man/` have been re-generated, so that they give rise to valid HTML5. (This is the impetus for this release, to keep the package safely on CRAN.)"
reprex,6,2,8,"reprex's condition signalling has been updated to use the current approaches provided by the cli, rlang, and lifecycle packages."
reprex,NA,1,13,"When `reprex()` is called without `expr` or `input`, in a context where the user's clipboard can't be reached from R, the default is now to consult the current selection for reprex source. Previously this was only available via the `reprex_selection()` addin. Note that this ""current selection"" default behaviour propagates to convenience wrappers around `reprex()`, such as `reprex_locale()` and venue-specific functions like `reprex_r()`, and to the un-`reprex()` functions, such as `reprex_clean()`."
reprex,NA,1,14,"In this context, the file containing the (un)rendered reprex is opened so the user can manually copy its contents."
reprex,NA,1,16,"To reprex in the current working directory,\ Previously: `reprex(outfile = NA)`\ Now: `reprex(wd = ""."")`\ More generally, usage looks like `reprex(wd = ""path/to/desired/wd"")`."
reprex,NA,1,17,"If you really care about reprex filename (and location), write your source to `path/to/stuff.R` and call `reprex(input = ""path/to/stuff.R"")`. When `input` is a filepath, that filepath determines the working directory and how reprex files are named and `wd` is never even consulted."
reprex,NA,1,20,We explicitly make sure that the working directory of the `callr::r()` call is the same as the effective working directory of the reprex.
reprex,NA,1,21,We alert the user that a local `.Rprofile` has been found.
reprex,NA,1,22,We indicate the usage of a local `.Rprofile` in the rendered reprex.
reprex,NA,1,25,rstudioapi moves from Suggests to Imports. Related to improving the experience when reprex cannot access the user's clipboard.
reprex,NA,1,26,mockr is new in Suggests; it's used in the tests.
reprex,NA,1,27,"We bumped the documented minimum version of Pandoc, because we use the `gfm` markdown variant to get GitHub-Flavored Markdown. The `gfm` variant was introduced in Pandoc 2.0 (released 2017-10-29)."
reprex,NA,1,28,"`reprex_VENUE(...)` is a new way to call `reprex(..., venue = ""VENUE"")`. For example, `reprex_r()` is equivalent to `reprex(venue = ""r"")`. This makes non-default venues easier to access via auto-completion (#256)."
reprex,NA,1,29,"`""slack""` is a new venue that tweaks the default Markdown output for pasting into Slack messages. It removes the `r` language identifier from the opening code fence, simplifies image links and, by default, suppresses the ad. Note that `venue = ""slack""` or `reprex_slack()` work best for people who opt-out of the WYSIWYG message editor: in *Preferences \> Advanced*, select ""Format messages with markup""."
reprex,NA,1,30,"`venue = ""so""` (SO = Stack Overflow) has converged with default `venue = ""gh""` (GitHub). As of January 2019, SO [supports CommonMark fenced code blocks](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/125148/implement-style-fenced-markdown-code-blocks/322000#322000). The only remaining difference is that Stack Overflow does not support the collapsible details tag that we use on GitHub to reduce the clutter from, e.g., session info (#231)."
reprex,NA,1,31,"`""rtf""` (Rich Text Format) is a new experimental `venue` for pasting into applications like PowerPoint and Keynote. It is experimental because it requires a working installation of the highlight command line tool, which is left as a somewhat fiddly exercise for the user (#331). `venue = ""rtf""` is documented in its [own article](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html)."
reprex,NA,1,32,"`reprex.current_venue` is a new read-only option that is set during `reprex_render()`. Other packages can use it to generate `reprex()`-compatible, `venue`-aware output, such as an renv lockfile."
reprex,NA,1,33,`reprex()` has been internally refactored to make better use of the official machinery for extending rmarkdown:
reprex,33,2,34,`reprex_document()` is a new R Markdown output format.
reprex,33,2,35,`reprex_render()` is a newly exported function.
reprex,33,2,36,"A `reprex_document()` is designed to be rendered with `reprex_render()`. `reprex_render()` is designed to act on a `reprex_document()`. This is (still) the heart of what the `reprex()` function does, in addition to various interface and workflow niceties."
reprex,33,2,37,"Two R Markdown templates ship with the package, which an RStudio user can access via *File \> New File \> R Markdown ... \> From Template*. One is minimal; the other uses lots of reprex features. Both include `knit: reprex::reprex_render` in the YAML, which causes the RStudio ""Knit"" button to use `reprex_render()`."
reprex,NA,1,38,"`prex()`, `prex_VENUE()`, and `prex_render()` are new **unexported** functions that, like `reprex()`, render a small bit of code, but with much less **re**producibility! The code is evaluated in the global workspace of the current process, with the current working directory. This pragmatic hack is useful when preparing a series of related snippets, e.g., for a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation, and there's not enough space to make each one self-contained."
reprex,NA,1,39,"UTF-8 encoding: Following the lead of knitr, reprex makes explicit use of UTF-8 internally (#237 @krlmlr, #261)."
reprex,NA,1,40,"When the reprex causes R to crash, `reprex(std_out_err = TRUE)` is able to provide more information about the crash, in some cases (#312)."
reprex,NA,1,41,"The `tidyverse_quiet` argument and `reprex.tidyverse_quiet` option also control startup messages from the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) meta-package (#326, @juliasilge)."
reprex,NA,1,42,`reprex_locale()` is a new thin wrapper around `reprex()` that renders in a temporarily-altered locale (#250).
reprex,NA,1,43,"The `si` argument of `reprex()` is now `session_info`. Being explicit seems more important than saving characters, given auto-completion."
reprex,NA,1,44,"The `show` argument of `reprex()` is now `html_preview`, for the sake of consistency with other R Markdown output formats."
reprex,NA,1,45,"New article on techniques for making package startup quieter (#187, @marionlouveaux)."
reprex,NA,1,47,"sessioninfo is new in Suggests, replacing devtools."
reprex,NA,1,48,"glue is new in Imports, replacing whisker."
reprex,NA,1,49,"knitr moves from Suggests to Imports (although it was already a hard dependency via rmarkdown), so we can require v1.23 or higher, which represents a major switch to UTF-8."
reprex,NA,1,50,cli is new in Imports.
reprex,NA,1,51,"reprex now relies on testthat \>= 3.0.0 and, specifically, uses third edition features."
reprex,NA,1,52,"The `crayon.enabled` option is explicitly set to `FALSE` when rendering the reprex (#238, #239)."
reprex,NA,1,53,"Expression input is once again captured via `substitute()` (as opposed to `rlang::enexpr()`), which is more favorable for reprexes involving tidy eval (#241)."
reprex,NA,1,54,"New venue ""html"" to render HTML fragments, useful for pasting in sites without markdown but that allow HTML (#236 @cwickham)."
reprex,NA,1,55,The YAML of reprex's template has been updated in light of the stricter YAML parser used in Pandoc \>= 2.2.2.
reprex,NA,1,56,`rlang::set_attrs()` has been soft-deprecated and is no longer used internally.
reprex,NA,1,57,"The reprex ad is formatted as superscript for `venue = ""gh""` and `venue = ""so""`, i.e. it is more subtle (#201)."
reprex,NA,1,58,"New experimental venue ""rtf"" produces syntax highlighted snippets suitable for pasting into presentation software such as Keynote or PowerPoint. This venue is discussed in [an article](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html) (#26)."
reprex,NA,1,59,Arguments `opts_chunk` and `opts_knit` have been removed from `reprex()`. The same effect has always been achievable via roxygen comments in the reprex code and the examples have always demonstrated this. Overriding knitr options doesn't seem to come up often enough in real-world `reprex()` usage to justify these arguments.
reprex,NA,1,60,Internal file system operations use the [fs](https://fs.r-lib.org) package. This should not make any user-facing changes in reprex and we definitely want to know if it does.
reprex,NA,1,67,"`advertise`: toggles inclusion of a footer that describes when and how the reprex was created, e.g., ""Created on 2017-11-16 by the reprex package (v0.1.1.9000)"". Defaults to `TRUE` (#121, #69)."
reprex,NA,1,68,"`style`: requests code restyling via the newly-Suggested styler package. styler can cope with tidyeval syntactical sugar, e.g. `df %>% group_by(!! group_var)`. Defaults to `FALSE` (#108, #94)."
reprex,NA,1,69,"`tidyverse_quiet`: affords control of the startup message of the tidyverse meta-package. Defaults to `TRUE`, i.e. suppresses the message (important special case of #70, #100)."
reprex,NA,1,70,"`std_out_err`: appends output sent to stdout and stderr by the reprex rendering process. This can be necessary to reveal output if the reprex spawns child processes or has `system()` calls. Defaults to `FALSE` (#90, #110)."
reprex,NA,1,71,`render`: determines if the reprex is actually rendered or just returns after producing the templated `.R` file. For internal testing.
reprex,NA,1,72,"Line wrapping is preserved from source via a Pandoc option (#145 @jimhester, #175)."
reprex,NA,1,73,"`venue = ""gh""` now targets CommonMark as the standard for GitHub Flavored Markdown (#77)."

reprex,NA,1,75,"`venue = ""ds""` is a new value, corresponding to <https://www.discourse.org>, which is the platform behind [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com). This is currently just an alias for the default `""gh""` GitHub venue, because the formatting appears to be compatible. Adding the `""ds""` value so Discourse can be documented and to guard against the possibility that some formatting is actually unique."
reprex,NA,1,76,"The `keep.source` option is set to `TRUE` when rendering the reprex, so reprexes involving srcrefs should work (#152)."
reprex,NA,1,77,"The ""undo"" functions (`reprex_invert()`, `reprex_clean()`, `reprex_rescue()`) handle `input` and `outfile` like `reprex()` does. The `outfile` argument is new (#129, #68)."
reprex,NA,1,78,"The default value for knitr's `upload.fun` is now set according to the venue. It is `knitr::imgur_upload()` for all venues except `""r""`, where it is `identity` (#125)."

reprex,NA,1,80,More rigorous use of UTF-8 encoding (#76 @yutannihilation).
reprex,NA,1,81,"Expression input handling has been refactored. As a result, formatR is no longer Suggested. Trailing comments -- inline and on their own line -- are also now retained (#89, #91, #114, @jennybc and @jimhester)."
reprex,NA,1,82,"Custom prompts are now escaped when used in regexes (#98, #99 @jimhester). Embedded newlines are now escaped."
reprex,NA,1,84,Pandoc added to SystemRequirements.
reprex,NA,1,85,"`outfile = NA` causes outfiles to be left in working directory. Filenames will be based on the `input` file, if there was one."
reprex,NA,1,86,`reprex()` strips any leading prompts from input code.
reprex,NA,1,87,"Added functions `reprex_clean()`, `reprex_invert()`, and `reprex_rescue()` in order to go backwards, i.e. recover source from a wild-caught reprex."
reprex,NA,1,88,"`venue = ""R""` (or `""r""`) can be used to get an R script back, augmented with commented output."
reprex,NA,1,89,`comment` argument added to specify prefix for commented output.
reprex,NA,1,90,"Added an RStudio addin, accessed via ""Render reprex""."
reprex,NA,1,91,"`input` argument to `reprex()` and friends handles code as string, character vector, or file path."
reprex,NA,1,92,"The reprex is rendered via `callr::r_safe()` and is thus run in a clean, separate R process, eliminating any leakage of objects or loaded packages to/from the calling session."
reprex,NA,1,93,"`reprex()` gains optional arguments `opts_chunk` and `opts_knit`, taking named list as input, in order to supplement or override default knitr chunk and package options, respectively. (#33)"
reprex,93,2,94,"This made the explicit `upload.fun` argument unnecessary, so it's gone. The `upload.fun` option defaults to `knitr::imgur_upload`, which means figures produced by the reprex will be uploaded to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and the associated image syntax will be put into the Markdown, e.g. `![](https://i.imgur.com/QPU5Cg9.png)`. (#15 @paternogbc)"
reprex,NA,1,95,Order of `reprex()` arguments has changed.
reprex,NA,1,96,"`reprex()` gains the `si` argument to request that `devtools::session_info()` or `sessionInfo()` be appended to reprex code (#6 @dgrtwo). When `si = TRUE` and `venue = ""gh""` (the default), session info is wrapped in a collapsible details tag. See [an example](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex/issues/55) (#55)."
reprex,NA,1,97,"Reprex code can be provided as an R expression. (#6 @dgrtwo, #35)"
reprex,NA,1,98,"`reprex()` uses clipboard functionality from [`clipr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clipr) and thus should work on Windows and suitably prepared Unix-like systems, in addition to Mac OS. (#16 @mdlincoln)"
reprex,NA,1,99,I tweeted about this and some people actually used it!
rlang,NA,1,1,`as_closure(seq.int)` now works (#1468).
rlang,NA,1,2,rlang no longer stores errors and backtraces in a `org:r-lib` environment on the search path.
rlang,NA,1,3,The low-level function `error_call()` is now exported (#1474).
rlang,NA,1,4,Fixed an issue that caused a failure about a missing `is_character` function when rlang is installed alongside an old version of vctrs (#1482).
rlang,NA,1,5,Fixed an issue that caused multiline calls in backtraces.
rlang,NA,1,6,The C API function `r_lgl_which()` now propagates the names of the input (#1471).
rlang,NA,1,7,"The `pkg_version_info()` function now allows `==` for package version comparison (#1469, @kryekuzhinieri)."
rlang,NA,1,8,Fixed backtrace display with calls containing long lists of arguments (#1456).
rlang,NA,1,9,New `r_obj_type_friendly()` function in the C library (#1463). It interfaces with `obj_type_friendly()` from `compat-obj-type.R` via a C callable.
rlang,NA,1,10,`is_installed()` no longer throws an error with irregular package names.
rlang,NA,1,11,`is_installed()` and `check_installed()` now properly detect that the base package is installed on older versions of R (#1434).
rlang,NA,1,12,Child errors may now have empty messages to enable this pattern:
rlang,NA,1,13,The `rlib_bytes` class now uses prettyunits to format bytes. The bytes are now represented with decimal prefixes instead of binary prefixes.
rlang,NA,1,14,Supplying a frame environment to the `call` argument of `abort()` now causes the corresponding function call in the backtrace to be highlighted.
rlang,NA,1,15,"In addition, if you store the argument name of a failing input in the `arg` error field, the argument is also highlighted in the backtrace."
rlang,NA,1,16,Instead of:
rlang,NA,1,17,You can now write this to benefit from arg highlighting:
rlang,NA,1,18,"`abort(message = )` can now be a function. In this case, it is stored in the `header` field and acts as a `cnd_header()` method invoked when the message is displayed."
rlang,NA,1,19,New `obj_type_oo()` function in `compat-obj-type.R` (#1426).
rlang,NA,1,20,`friendly_type_of()` from `compat-obj-type.R` (formerly `compat-friendly-type.R`) is now `obj_type_friendly()`.
rlang,NA,1,21,"`options(backtrace_on_error = ""collapse"")` and `print(trace, simplify = ""collapse"")` are deprecated. They fall back to `""none""` with a warning."
rlang,NA,1,22,`call_match()` now better handles `...` when `dots_expand = FALSE`.
rlang,NA,1,23,`list2(!!!x)` is now faster when `x` is a list. It is now returned as is instead of being duplicated into a new list.
rlang,NA,1,24,`abort()` gains a `.trace_bottom` argument to disambiguate from other `.frame`. This allows `cli::cli_abort()` to wrap `abort()` in such a way that `.internal` mentions the correct package to report the error in (#1386).
rlang,NA,1,25,The `transpose()` compat is now more consistent with purrr when inner names are not congruent (#1346).
rlang,NA,1,26,New `reset_warning_verbosity()` and `reset_message_verbosity()` functions. These reset the verbosity of messages signalled with `warn()` and `inform()` with the `.frequency` argument. This is useful for testing verbosity in your package (#1414).
rlang,NA,1,27,`check_dots_empty()` now allows trailing missing arguments (#1390).
rlang,NA,1,28,Calls to local functions that are not accessible through `::` or `:::` are now marked with `(local)` in backtraces (#1399).
rlang,NA,1,29,Error messages now mention indexed calls like `foo$bar()`.
rlang,NA,1,30,"New `env_coalesce()` function to copy bindings from one environment to another. Unlike approaches based on looping with `[[<-`, `env_coalesce()` preserves active and lazy bindings."
rlang,NA,1,31,Chaining errors at top-level (directly in the console instead of in a function) no longer fails (#1405).
rlang,NA,1,32,Warning style is propagated across parent errors in chained error messages (#1387).
rlang,NA,1,33,"`check_installed()` now works within catch-all `tryCatch(error = )` expressions (#1402, tidyverse/ggplot2#4845)."
rlang,NA,1,34,`arg_match()` and `arg_match0()` now mention the correct call in case of type error (#1388).
rlang,NA,1,35,`abort()` and `inform()` now print messages to `stdout` in RStudio panes (#1393).
rlang,NA,1,36,`is_installed()` now detects unsealed namespaces (#1378). This fixes inconsistent behaviour when run within user onLoad hooks.
rlang,NA,1,37,Source references in backtraces and `last_error()`/`last_trace()` instructions are now clickable in IDEs that support links (#1396).
rlang,NA,1,38,`compat-cli.R` now supports `style_hyperlink()`.
rlang,NA,1,39,"`abort(.homonyms = ""error"")` now throws the expected error (#1394)."
rlang,NA,1,40,`env_binding_are_active()` no longer accidentally triggers active bindings (#1376).
rlang,NA,1,41,Fixed bug in `quo_squash()` with nested quosures containing the missing argument.
rlang,NA,1,42,Backtraces of parent errors are now reused on rethrow. This avoids capturing the same backtrace twice and solves consistency problems by making sure both errors in a chain have the same backtrace.
rlang,NA,1,43,Fixed backtrace oversimplification when `cnd` is a base error in `abort(parent = cnd)`.
rlang,NA,1,44,Internal errors thrown with `abort(.internal = TRUE)` now mention the name of the package the error should be reported to.
rlang,NA,1,45,Backtraces are now separated from error messages with a `---` ruler line (#1368).
rlang,NA,1,46,"The internal bullet formatting routine now ignores unknown names (#1364). This makes it consistent with the cli package, increases resilience against hard-to-detect errors, and increases forward compatibility."
rlang,NA,1,47,"`abort()` and friends no longer calls non-existent functions (e.g. `cli::format_error()` or `cli::format_warning`) when the installed version of cli is too old (#1367, tidyverse/dplyr#6189)."
rlang,NA,1,48,Fixed an OOB subsetting error in `abort()`.
rlang,NA,1,49,"New `rlang_call_format_srcrefs` global option (#1349). Similar to `rlang_trace_format_srcrefs`, this option allows turning off the display of srcrefs in error calls. This can be useful for reproducibility but note that srcrefs are already disabled within testthat by default."
rlang,NA,1,50,`abort(parent = NA)` is now supported to indicate an unchained rethrow. This helps `abort()` detect the condition handling context to create simpler backtraces where this context is hidden by default.
rlang,NA,1,51,"When `parent` is supplied, `abort()` now loops over callers to detect the condition handler frame. This makes it easier to wrap or extract condition handlers in functions without supplying `.frame`."
rlang,NA,1,52,"When `parent` is supplied and `call` points to the condition setup frame (e.g. `withCallingHandlers()` or `try_fetch()`), `call` is replaced with the caller of that setup frame. This provides a more helpful default call."
rlang,NA,1,53,`is_call()` is now implemented in C for performance.
rlang,NA,1,54,Fixed performance regression in `trace_back()`.
rlang,NA,1,55,"Fixed a partial matching issue with `header`, `body`, and `footer` condition fields."
rlang,NA,1,56,`eval_tidy()` calls are no longer mentioned in error messages.
rlang,NA,1,58,`abort()` now displays errors as fully bulleted lists. Error headers are displayed with a `!` prefix. See <https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-customisation.html> to customise the display of error messages.
rlang,NA,1,59,"`abort()` now displays a full chain of messages when errors are chained with the `parent` argument. Following this change, you should update dplyr to version 1.0.8 to get proper error messages."
rlang,NA,1,60,`abort()` now displays function calls in which a message originated by default. We have refrained from showing these calls until now to avoid confusing messages when an error is thrown from a helper function that isn't relevant to users.
rlang,NA,1,61,"To help with these cases, `abort()` now takes a `call` argument that you can set to `caller_env()` or `parent.frame()` when used in a helper function. The function call corresponding to this environment is retrieved and stored in the condition."
rlang,NA,1,62,"cli formatting is now supported. Use `cli::cli_abort()` to get advanced formatting of error messages, including indented bulleted lists. See <https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-formatting.html>."
rlang,NA,1,63,New `try_fetch()` function for error handling. We recommend to use it for chaining errors. It mostly works like `tryCatch()` with a few important differences.
rlang,63,2,64,"Compared to `tryCatch()`, `try_fetch()` preserves the call stack. This allows full backtrace capture and allows `recover()` to reach the error site."
rlang,63,2,65,"Compared to `withCallingHandler()`, `try_fetch()` is able to handle stack overflow errors (this requires R 4.2, unreleased at the time of writing)."
rlang,NA,1,66,"The tidy eval documentation has been fully rewritten to reflect current practices. Access it through the ""Tidy evaluation"" and ""Metaprogramming"" menus on <https://rlang.r-lib.org>."
rlang,NA,1,67,The `.data` object exported by rlang now fails when subsetted instead of returning `NULL`. This new error helps you detect when `.data` is used in the wrong context.
rlang,NA,1,68,We've noticed several packages failing after this change because they were using `.data` outside of a data-masking context. For instance the `by` argument of `dplyr::join()` is not data-masked. Previously `dplyr::join(by = .data$foo)` would silently be interpreted as `dplyr::join(by = NULL)`. This is now an error.
rlang,NA,1,69,Another issue is using `.data` inside `ggplot2::labs(...)`. This is not allowed since `labs()` isn't data-masked.
rlang,NA,1,70,"`call_name()` now returns `NULL` instead of `""::""` for calls of the form `foo::bar`."
rlang,NA,1,71,"We've noticed some packages do not check for `NULL` results from `call_name()`. Note that many complex calls such as `foo()()`, `foo$bar()` don't have a ""name"" and cause a `NULL` result. This is why you should always check for `NULL` results when using `call_name()`."
rlang,NA,1,72,We've added the function `is_call_simple()` to make it easier to work safely with `call_name()`. The invariant is that `call_name()` always returns a string when `is_call_simple()` returns `TRUE`. Conversely it always returns `NULL` when `is_call_simple()` retuns `FALSE`.
rlang,NA,1,73,"`is_expression()` now returns `FALSE` for manually constructed expressions that can't be created by the parser. It used to return `TRUE` for any calls, including those that contain injected objects."
rlang,NA,1,74,Consider using `is_call()` or just remove the expression check. In many cases it is fine letting all objects go through when an expression is expected. For instance you can inject objects directly inside dplyr arguments:
rlang,NA,1,75,"If a string is supplied to `as_function()` instead of an object (function or formula), the function is looked up in the global environment instead of the calling environment. In general, passing a function name as a string is brittle. It is easy to forget to pass the user environment to `as_function()` and sometimes there is no obvious user environment. The support for strings should be considered a convenience for end users only, not for programmers."
rlang,NA,1,76,"Since environment forwarding is easy to mess up, and since the feature is aimed towards end users, `as_function()` now defaults to the global environment. Supply an environment explicitly if that is not correct in your case."
rlang,NA,1,77,"`with_handlers()`, `call_fn()`, and `friendly_type()` are deprecated."
rlang,NA,1,78,"The `action` argument of `check_dots_used()`, `check_dots_unnamed()`, and `check_dots_empty()` is deprecated in favour of the new `error` argument which takes an error handler."
rlang,NA,1,79,Many functions deprecated deprecated in rlang 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 have been removed from the package.
rlang,NA,1,80,New `englue()` operator to allow string-embracing outside of dynamic dots (#1172).
rlang,NA,1,81,New `data_sym()` and `data_syms()` functions to create calls of the form `.data$foo`.
rlang,NA,1,82,"`.data` now fails early when it is subsetted outside of a data mask context. This provides a more informative error message (#804, #1133)."
rlang,NA,1,83,"`as_label()` now better handles calls to infix operators (#956, r-lib/testthat#1432). This change improves auto-labelled expressions in data-masking functions like `tibble()`, `mutate()`, etc."
rlang,NA,1,84,"The `{{` operator is now detected more strictly (#1087). If additional arguments are supplied through `{`, it is no longer interpreted as an injection operator."
rlang,NA,1,85,"The `.ignore_empty` argument of `enexprs()` and `enquos()` no longer treats named arguments supplied through `...` as empty, consistently with `exprs()` and `quos()` (#1229)."
rlang,NA,1,86,Fixed a hang when a quosure inheriting from a data mask is evaluated in the mask again.
rlang,NA,1,87,"Fixed performance issue when splicing classes that explicitly inherit from list with `!!!` (#1140, r-lib/vctrs#1170)."
rlang,NA,1,88,Attributes of quosure lists are no longer modified by side effect (#1142).
rlang,NA,1,89,"`enquo()`, `enquos()` and variants now support numbered dots like `..1` (#1137)."
rlang,NA,1,90,Fixed a bug in the AST rotation algorithm that caused the `!!` operator to unexpectedly mutate injected objects (#1103).
rlang,NA,1,91,Fixed AST rotation issue with `!!` involving binary operators (#1125).
rlang,NA,1,92,`try_fetch()` is a flexible alternative to both `tryCatch()` and `withCallingHandlers()` (#503). It is also more efficient than `tryCatch()` and creates leaner backtraces.
rlang,NA,1,93,New `cnd_inherits()` function to detect a class in a chain of errors (#1293).
rlang,NA,1,94,"New `global_entrace()` function, a user-friendly helper for configuring errors in your RProfile. Call it to enrich all base errors and warnings with an rlang backtrace. This enables `last_error()`, `last_warnings()`, `last_messages()`, and `backtrace_on_error` support for all conditions."
rlang,NA,1,95,New `global_handle()` function to install a default configuration of error handlers. This currently calls `global_entrace()` and `global_prompt_install()`. Expect more to come.
rlang,NA,1,96,"The ""Error:"" part of error messages is now printed by rlang instead of R. This introduces several cosmetic and informative changes in errors thrown by `abort()`:"
rlang,96,2,97,"The `call` field of error messages is now displayed, as is the default in `base::stop()`. The call is only displayed if it is a simple expression (e.g. no inlined function) and the arguments are not displayed to avoid distracting from the error message. The message is formatted with the tidyverse style (`code` formatting by the cli package if available)."
rlang,96,2,98,The source location is displayed (as in `base::stop()`) if `call` carries a source reference. Source locations are not displayed when testthat is running to avoid brittle snapshots.
rlang,96,2,99,"Error headers are always displayed on their own line, with a `""!""` bullet prefix."
rlang,NA,1,100,See <https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-customisation.html> to customise this new display.
rlang,NA,1,101,"The display of chained errors created with the `parent` argument of `abort()` has been improved. Chains of errors are now displayed at throw time with the error prefix ""Caused by error:""."
rlang,NA,1,102,The `print()` method of rlang errors (commonly invoked with `last_error()`) has been improved:
rlang,102,2,103,Display calls if present.
rlang,102,2,104,Chained errors are displayed more clearly.
rlang,NA,1,105,`inform()` and `warn()` messages can now be silenced with the global options `rlib_message_verbosity` and `rlib_warning_verbosity`.
rlang,NA,1,106,"`abort()` now outputs error messages to `stdout` in interactive sessions, following the same approach as `inform()`."
rlang,NA,1,107,"Errors, warnings, and messages generated from rlang are now formatted with cli. This means in practice that long lines are width-wrapped to the terminal size and user themes are applied. This is currently only the case for rlang messages."
rlang,NA,1,108,"This special formatting is not applied when `abort()`, `warn()`, and `inform()` are called from another namespace than rlang. See <https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-condition-formatting.html> if you'd like to use cli to format condition messages in your package."
rlang,NA,1,109,`format_error_bullets()` (used as a fallback instead of cli) now treats:
rlang,109,2,110,Unnamed elements as unindented line breaks (#1130)
rlang,109,2,111,"Elements named `""v""` as green ticks (@rossellhayes)"
rlang,109,2,112,"Elements named `"" ""` as indented line breaks"
rlang,109,2,113,"Elements named `""*""` as normal bullets"
rlang,109,2,114,"Elements named `""!""` as warning bullets"
rlang,NA,1,115,"For convenience, a fully unnamed vector is interpreted as a vector of `""*""` bullets."
rlang,NA,1,116,"`abort()` gains a `.internal` argument. When set to `TRUE`, a footer bullet is added to `message` to let the user know that the error is internal and that they should report it to the package authors."
rlang,NA,1,117,"`abort()`, `warn()`, and `inform()` gain a `body` argument to supply additional bullets in the error message."
rlang,NA,1,118,"rlang conditions now have `as.character()` methods. Use this generic on conditions to generate a whole error message, including the `Error:` prefix. These methods are implemented as wrappers around `cnd_message()`."
rlang,NA,1,119,`header` and `footer` methods can now be stored as closures in condition fields of the same name.
rlang,NA,1,120,"`cnd_message()` gains a `prefix` argument to print the message with a full prefix, including `call` field if present and parent messages if the condition is chained."
rlang,NA,1,121,`cnd_message()` gains an `inherit` argument to control whether to print the messages of parent errors.
rlang,NA,1,122,Condition constructors now check for duplicate field names (#1268).
rlang,NA,1,123,"`cnd_footer()` now returns the `footer` field by default, if any."
rlang,NA,1,124,"`warn()` and `inform()` now signal conditions of classes `""rlang_warning""` and `""rlang_message""` respectively."
rlang,NA,1,125,The `body` field of error conditions can now be a character vector.
rlang,NA,1,126,"The error returned by `last_error()` is now stored on the search path as the `.Last.error` binding of the `""org:r-lib""` environment. This is consistent with how the processx package records error conditions. Printing the `.Last.error` object is now equivalent to running `last_error()`."
rlang,NA,1,127,"Added `is_error()`, `is_warning()`, and `is_message()` predicates (#1220)."
rlang,NA,1,128,`interrupt()` no longer fails when interrupts are suspended (#1224).
rlang,NA,1,129,"`warn()` now temporarily sets the `warning.length` global option to the maximum value (8170). The default limit (1000 characters) is especially easy to hit when the message contains a lot of ANSI escapes, as created by the crayon or cli packages (#1211)."
rlang,NA,1,130,`entrace()` and `global_entrace()` now log warnings and messages with backtraces attached. Run `last_warnings()` or `last_messages()` to inspect the warnings or messages emitted during the last command.
rlang,NA,1,131,Internal errors now include a winch backtrace if installed. The user is invited to install it if not installed.
rlang,NA,1,132,"Display of rlang backtraces for expected errors in dynamic reports (chunks where `error = TRUE` in knitted documents and RStudio notebooks) is now controlled by the `rlang_backtrace_on_error_report` option. By default, this is set to `""none""`."
rlang,NA,1,133,The display of backtraces for *unexpected* errors (in chunks where `error` is unset or set to `FALSE`) is still controlled by `rlang_backtrace_on_error`.
rlang,NA,1,134,The `last_error()` reminder is no longer displayed in RStudio notebooks.
rlang,NA,1,135,A `knitr::sew()` method is registered for `rlang_error`. This makes it possible to consult `last_error()` (the call must occur in a different chunk than the error) and to set `rlang_backtrace_on_error_report` global options in knitr to display a backtrace for expected errors.
rlang,NA,1,136,"If you show rlang backtraces in a knitted document, also set this in a hidden chunk to trim the knitr context from the backtraces:"
rlang,NA,1,137,This change replaces an ad hoc mechanism that caused bugs in corner cases (#1205).
rlang,NA,1,138,"The `rlang_trace_top_env` global option for `trace_back()` now detects when backtraces are created within knitr. If the option is not set, its default value becomes `knitr::knit_global()` when knitr is in progress (as determined from `knitr.in.progress` global option). This prevents the knitr evaluation context from appearing in the backtraces (#932)."
rlang,NA,1,139,Namespace changes are now emboldened in backtraces (#946).
rlang,NA,1,140,Functions defined in the global environments or in local execution environments are now displayed with a space separator in backtraces instead of `::` and `:::`. This avoids making it seem like these frame calls are valid R code ready to be typed in (#902).
rlang,NA,1,141,"Backtraces no longer contain inlined objects to avoid performance issues in edge cases (#1069, r-lib/testthat#1223)."
rlang,NA,1,142,External backtraces in error chains are now separately displayed (#1098).
rlang,NA,1,143,Trace capture now better handles wrappers of calling handler in case of rethrown chained errors.
rlang,NA,1,144,Backtraces now print dangling srcrefs (#1206). Paths are shortened to show only three components (two levels of folder and the file).
rlang,NA,1,145,The root symbol in backtraces is now slightly different so that it can't be confused with a prompt character (#1207).
rlang,NA,1,146,`arg_match()` gains a `multiple` argument for cases where zero or several matches are allowed (#1281).
rlang,NA,1,147,New function `check_required()` to check that an argument is supplied. It produces a more friendly error message than `force()` (#1118).
rlang,NA,1,148,"`check_dots_empty()`, `check_dots_used()`, and `check_dots_unnamed()` have been moved from ellipsis to rlang. The ellipsis package is deprecated and will eventually be archived."
rlang,NA,1,149,We have added `check_dots_empty0()`. It has a different UI but is almost as efficient as checking for `missing(...)`. Use this in very low level functions where a couple microseconds make a difference.
rlang,NA,1,150,The `arg_nm` argument of `arg_match0()` must now be a string or symbol.
rlang,NA,1,151,`arg_match()` now mentions the supplied argument (#1113).
rlang,NA,1,152,`is_installed()` and `check_installed()` gain a `version` argument (#1165).
rlang,NA,1,153,`check_installed()` now consults the `rlib_restart_package_not_found` global option to determine whether to prompt users to install packages. This also disables the restart mechanism (see below).
rlang,NA,1,154,`check_installed()` now signals errors of class `rlib_error_package_not_found` with a `rlib_restart_package_not_found` restart. This allows calling handlers to install the required packages and restart the check (#1150).
rlang,NA,1,155,"`is_installed()` and `check_installed()` now support DESCRIPTION-style version requirements like `""rlang (>= 1.0)""`. They also gain `version` and `compare` arguments to supply requirements programmatically."
rlang,NA,1,156,`check_installed()` gains an `action` argument that is called when the user chooses to install and update missing and outdated packages.
rlang,NA,1,157,New `check_exclusive()` function to check that only one argument of a set is supplied (#1261).
rlang,NA,1,158,`on_load()` and `run_on_load()` lets you run `.onLoad()` expressions from any file of your package. `on_package_load()` runs expressions when another package is loaded. (#1284)
rlang,NA,1,159,The new predicate `is_call_simple()` indicates whether a call has a name and/or a namespace. It provides two invariants:
rlang,159,2,160,"If `is_call_simple(x)` is `TRUE`, `call_name()` always returns a string."
rlang,159,2,161,"If `is_call_simple(x, ns = TRUE)` is `TRUE`, `call_ns()` always returns a string."
rlang,NA,1,162,`call_name()` and `call_ns()` now return `NULL` with calls of the form `foo::bar` (#670).
rlang,NA,1,163,"New `current_call()`, `caller_call()`, and `frame_call()` accessors. New `frame_fn()` accessor."
rlang,NA,1,164,`env_has()` and the corresponding C-level function no longer force active bindings (#1292).
rlang,NA,1,165,New `names2<-` replacement function that never adds missing values when names don't have names (#1301).
rlang,NA,1,166,`zap_srcref()` now preserves attributes of closures.
rlang,NA,1,167,"Objects headers (as printed by `last_error()`, `env_print()`, ...) are now formatted using the `cls` class of the cli package."
rlang,NA,1,168,`as_function()` gains `arg` and `call` arguments to provide contextual information about erroring inputs.
rlang,NA,1,169,`is_expression()` now returns `FALSE` for manually constructed expressions that cannot be created by the R parser.
rlang,NA,1,170,"New C callable `rlang_env_unbind()`. This is a wrapper around `R_removeVarFromFrame()` on R \>= 4.0.0. On older R this wraps the R function `base::rm()`. Unlike `rm()`, this function does not warn (nor throw) when a binding does not exist."
rlang,NA,1,171,`friendly_type_of()` now supports missing arguments.
rlang,NA,1,172,"`env_clone()` now properly clones active bindings and avoids forcing promises (#1228). On R \< 4.0, promises are still forced."
rlang,NA,1,173,Fixed an `s3_register()` issue when the registering package is a dependency of the package that exports the generic (#1225).
rlang,NA,1,174,Added `compat-vctrs.R` file for robust manipulation of data frames in zero-deps packages.
rlang,NA,1,175,Added `compat-cli.R` file to format message elements consistently with cli in zero-deps packages.
rlang,NA,1,176,`compat-purrr.R` now longer includes `pluck*` helpers; these used a defintion of pluck that predated purrr (#1159). `*_cpl()` has also been removed. The `map*` wrappers now call `as_function()` so that you can pass short anonymous functions that use `~` (#1157).
rlang,NA,1,177,`exprs_auto_name()` gains a `repair_auto` argument to make automatic names unique (#1116).
rlang,NA,1,178,"The `.named` argument of `dots_list()` can now be set to `NULL` to give the result default names. With this option, fully unnamed inputs produce a fully unnamed result with `NULL` names instead of a character vector of minimal `""""` names (#390)."
rlang,NA,1,179,`is_named2()` is a variant of `is_named()` that always returns `TRUE` for empty vectors (#191). It tests for the property that each element of a vector is named rather than the presence of a `names` attribute.
rlang,NA,1,180,New `rlib_bytes` class imported from the bench package (#1117). It prints and parses human-friendly sizes.
rlang,NA,1,181,"The `env` argument of `as_function()` now defaults to the global environment. Its previous default was the caller of `as_function()`, which was rarely the correct environment to look in. Since it's hard to remember to pass the user environment and it's sometimes tricky to keep track of it, it's best to consider string lookup as a convenience for end users, not for developers (#1170)."
rlang,NA,1,182,`s3_register()` no longer fails when generic does not exist. This prevents failures when users don't have all the last versions of packages (#1112).
rlang,NA,1,183,Formulas are now deparsed according to the tidyverse style guide (`~symbol` without space and `~ expression()` with a space).
rlang,NA,1,184,"New `hash_file()`, complementing `hash()`, to generate 128-bit hashes for the data within a file without loading it into R (#1134)."
rlang,NA,1,185,New `env_cache()` function to retrieve a value or create it with a default if it doesn't exist yet (#1081).
rlang,NA,1,186,`env_get()` and `env_get_list()` gain a `last` argument. Lookup stops in that environment. This can be useful in conjunction with `base::topenv()`.
rlang,NA,1,187,New `call_match()` function. It is like `match.call()` but also supports matching missing arguments to their defaults in the function definition (#875).
rlang,NA,1,188,`call_standardise()` is deprecated in favour of `call_match()`.
rlang,NA,1,189,"`expr_deparse()` now properly escapes `\` characters in symbols, argument names, and vector names (#1160)."
rlang,NA,1,190,`friendly_type_of()` (from `compat-friendly-type.R`) now supports matrices and arrays (#141).
rlang,NA,1,191,Updated `env_print()` to use `format_error_bullets()` and consistent tidyverse style (#1154).
rlang,NA,1,192,"`set_names()` now recycles names of size 1 to the size of the input, following the tidyverse recycling rules."
rlang,NA,1,193,`is_bare_formula()` now handles the `scoped` argument consistently. The default has been changed to `TRUE` for compatibility with the historical default behaviour (#1115).
rlang,NA,1,194,"The ""definition"" API (`dots_definitions()` etc.) has been archived."
rlang,NA,1,195,New `is_complex()` predicates to complete the family (#1127).
rlang,NA,1,196,The C function `r_obj_address()` now properly prefixes addresses with the hexadecimal prefix `0x` on Windows (#1135).
rlang,NA,1,197,`obj_address()` is now exported.
rlang,NA,1,198,`%<~%` now actually works.
rlang,NA,1,199,`XXH3_64bits()` from the XXHash library is now exposed as C callable under the name `rlang_xxh3_64bits()`.
rlang,NA,1,200,Fix for CRAN checks.
rlang,NA,1,201,Fix for CRAN checks.
rlang,NA,1,202,Fixed a gcc11 warning related to `hash()` (#1088).
rlang,NA,1,203,"New `hash()` function to generate 128-bit hashes for arbitrary R objects using the xxHash library. The implementation is modeled after [xxhashlite](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/xxhashlite), created by @coolbutuseless."
rlang,NA,1,204,"New `check_installed()` function. Unlike `is_installed()`, it asks the user whether to install missing packages. If the user accepts, the packages are installed with `pak::pkg_install()` if available, or `utils::install.packages()` otherwise. If the session is non interactive or if the user chooses not to install the packages, the current evaluation is aborted (#1075)."
rlang,NA,1,205,rlang is now licensed as MIT (#1063).
rlang,NA,1,206,"Fixed an issue causing extra empty lines in `inform()` messages with `.frequency` (#1076, @schloerke)."
rlang,NA,1,207,"`expr_deparse()` now correctly wraps code using `::` and `:::` (#1072, @krlmlr)."
rlang,NA,1,208,Dropped support for the R 3.2 series.
rlang,NA,1,209,"`inject()` evaluates its argument with `!!`, `!!!`, and `{{` support."
rlang,NA,1,210,New `enquo0()` and `enquos0()` operators for defusing function arguments without automatic injection (unquotation).
rlang,NA,1,211,"`format_error_bullets()` is no longer experimental. The `message` arguments of `abort()`, `warn()`, and `inform()` are automatically passed to that function to make it easy to create messages with regular, info, and error bullets. See `?format_error_bullets` for more information."
rlang,NA,1,212,New `zap_srcref()` function to recursively remove source references from functions and calls.
rlang,NA,1,213,A new compat file for the zeallot operator `%<-%` is now available in the rlang repository.
rlang,NA,1,214,New `%<~%` operator to define a variable lazily.
rlang,NA,1,215,New `env_browse()` and `env_is_browsed()` functions. `env_browse()` is equivalent to evaluating `browser()` within an environment. It sets the environment to be persistently browsable (or unsets it if `value = FALSE` is supplied).
rlang,NA,1,216,Functions created from quosures with `as_function()` now print in a more user friendly way.
rlang,NA,1,217,New `rlang_print_backtrace` C callable for debugging from C interpreters (#1059).
rlang,NA,1,218,The `.data` pronoun no longer skips functions (#1061). This solves a dplyr issue involving rowwise data frames and list-columns of functions (tidyverse/dplyr#5608).
rlang,NA,1,219,`as_data_mask()` now intialises environments of the correct size to improve efficiency (#1048).
rlang,NA,1,220,"`eval_bare()`, `eval_tidy()` (#961), and `with_handlers()` (#518) now propagate visibility."
rlang,NA,1,221,`cnd_signal()` now ignores `NULL` inputs.
rlang,NA,1,222,Fixed bug that prevented splicing a named empty vector with the `!!!` operator (#1045).
rlang,NA,1,223,"The exit status of is now preserved in non-interactive sessions when `entrace()` is used as an `options(error = )` handler (#1052, rstudio/bookdown#920)."
rlang,NA,1,224,`next` and `break` are now properly deparsed as nullary operators.
rlang,NA,1,225,Backtraces now include native stacks (e.g. from C code) when the [winch](https://r-prof.github.io/winch/) package is installed and `rlang_trace_use_winch` is set to `TRUE` (@krlmlr).
rlang,NA,1,226,Compatibility with upcoming testthat 3 and magrittr 2 releases.
rlang,NA,1,227,"`get_env()` now returns the proper environment with primitive functions, i.e. the base namespace rather than the base environment (r-lib/downlit#32)."
rlang,NA,1,228,`entrace()` no longer handles non-rlang errors that carry a backtrace. This improves compatibility with packages like callr.
rlang,NA,1,229,Backtraces of unhandled errors are now displayed without truncation in non-interactive sessions (#856).
rlang,NA,1,230,"`is_interactive()` no longer consults ""rstudio.notebook.executing"" option (#1031)."
rlang,NA,1,231,`cnd_muffle()` now returns `FALSE` instead of failing if the condition is not mufflable (#1022).
rlang,NA,1,232,`warn()` and `inform()` gain a `.frequency` argument to control how frequently the warning or message should be displayed.
rlang,NA,1,233,"New `raw_deparse_str()` function for converting a raw vector into a string of hexadecimal characters (@krlmlr, #978)."
rlang,NA,1,234,"The backtraces of chained errors are no longer decomposed by error context. Instead, the error messages are displayed as a tree to reflect the error ancestry, and the deepest backtrace in the ancestry is displayed."
rlang,NA,1,235,"This change simplifies the display (#851) and makes it possible to rethow errors from a calling handler rather than an exiting handler, which we now think is more appropriate because it allows users to `recover()` into the error."
rlang,NA,1,236,"`env_bind()`, `env_bind_active()`, `env_bind_lazy()`, `env_get()`, and `env_get_list()` have been rewritten in C."
rlang,NA,1,237,`env_poke()` now supports `zap()` sentinels for removing bindings (#1012) and has better support for characters that are not representable in the local encoding.
rlang,NA,1,238,`env_poke()` has been rewritten in C for performance.
rlang,NA,1,239,The unicode translation warnings that appeared on Windows with R 4.0 are now fixed.
rlang,NA,1,240,`env_unbind(inherit = TRUE)` now only removes a binding from the first parent environment that has a binding. It used to remove the bindings from the whole ancestry. The new behaviour doesn't guarantee that a scope doesn't have a binding but it is safer.
rlang,NA,1,241,`env_has()` is now rewritten in C for performance.
rlang,NA,1,242,`dots_list()` gains a `.named` argument for auto-naming dots (#957).
rlang,NA,1,243,It is now possible to subset the `.data` pronoun with quosured symbols or strings (#807).
rlang,NA,1,244,"Expressions like `quote(list(""a b"" = 1))` are now properly deparsed by `expr_deparse()` (#950)."
rlang,NA,1,245,"`parse_exprs()` now preserves names (#808). When a single string produces multiple expressions, the names may be useful to figure out what input produced which expression."
rlang,NA,1,246,`parse_exprs()` now supports empty expressions (#954).
rlang,NA,1,247,`list2(!!!x)` no longer evaluates `x` multiple times (#981).
rlang,NA,1,248,"`is_installed()` now properly handles a `pkg` argument of length \> 1. Before this it silently tested the first element of `pkg` only and thus always returned `TRUE` if the first package was installed regardless of the actual length of `pkg`. (#991, @salim-b)"
rlang,NA,1,249,"`arg_match0()` is a faster version of `arg_match()` for use when performance is at a premium (#997, @krlmlr)."
rlang,NA,1,250,"`!!!` now uses a combination of `length()`, `names()`, and `[[` to splice S3 and S4 objects. This produces more consistent behaviour than `as.list()` on a wider variety of vector classes (#945, tidyverse/dplyr#4931)."
rlang,NA,1,251,"`set_names()`, `is_formula()`, and `names2()` are now implemented in C for efficiency."
rlang,NA,1,252,The `.data` pronoun now accepts symbol subscripts (#836).
rlang,NA,1,253,"Quosure lists now explicitly inherit from `""list""`. This makes them compatible with the vctrs package (#928)."
rlang,NA,1,254,"All rlang options are now documented in a centralised place, see `?rlang::faq-options` (#899, @smingerson)."
rlang,NA,1,255,Fixed crash when `env_bindings_are_lazy()` gets improper arguments (#923).
rlang,NA,1,256,"`arg_match()` now detects and suggests possible typos in provided arguments (@jonkeane, #798)."
rlang,NA,1,257,"`arg_match()` now gives an error if argument is of length greater than 1 and doesn't exactly match the values input, similar to base `match.arg` (#914, @AliciaSchep)"
rlang,NA,1,258,Maintenance release for CRAN.
rlang,NA,1,259,"You can now use glue syntax to unquote on the LHS of `:=`. This syntax is automatically available in all functions taking dots with `list2()` and `enquos()`, and thus most of the tidyverse. Note that if you use the glue syntax in an R package, you need to import glue."
rlang,NA,1,260,A single pair of braces triggers normal glue interpolation:
rlang,NA,1,261,"Using a pair of double braces is for labelling a function argument. Technically, this is shortcut for `""{as_label(enquo(arg))}""`. The syntax is similar to the curly-curly syntax for interpolating function arguments:"
rlang,NA,1,262,Fixed a bug in magrittr backtraces that caused duplicate calls to appear in the trace.
rlang,NA,1,263,Fixed a bug in magrittr backtraces that caused wrong call indices.
rlang,NA,1,264,Empty backtraces are no longer shown when `rlang_backtrace_on_error` is set.
rlang,NA,1,265,The tidy eval `.env` pronoun is now exported for documentation purposes.
rlang,NA,1,266,`warn()` and `abort()` now check that either `class` or `message` was supplied. `inform()` allows sending empty message as it is occasionally useful for building user output incrementally.
rlang,NA,1,267,"`flatten()` fails with a proper error when input can't be flattened (#868, #885)."
rlang,NA,1,268,`inform()` now consistently appends a final newline to the message (#880).
rlang,NA,1,269,`cnd_body.default()` is now properly registered.
rlang,NA,1,270,`cnd_signal()` now uses the same approach as `abort()` to save unhandled errors to `last_error()`.
rlang,NA,1,271,Parsable constants like `NaN` and `NA_integer_` are now deparsed by `expr_deparse()` in their parsable form (#890).
rlang,NA,1,272,Infix operators now stick to their LHS when deparsed by `expr_deparse()` (#890).
rlang,NA,1,273,"New `cnd_header()`, `cnd_body()` and `cnd_footer()` generics. These are automatically called by `conditionMessage.rlang_error()`, the default method for all rlang errors."
rlang,NA,1,274,"Concretely, this is a way of breaking up lazy generation of error messages with `conditionMessage()` into three independent parts. This provides a lot of flexibility for hierarchies of error classes, for instance you could inherit the body of an error message from a parent class while overriding the header and footer."
rlang,NA,1,275,The reminder to call `last_error()` is now less confusing thanks to a suggestion by @markhwhiteii.
rlang,NA,1,276,"The functions prefixed in `scoped_` have been renamed to use the more conventional `local_` prefix. For instance, `scoped_bindings()` is now `local_bindings()`. The `scoped_` functions will be deprecated in the next significant version of rlang (0.5.0)."
rlang,NA,1,277,"The `.subclass` argument of `abort()`, `warn()` and `inform()` has been renamed to `class`. This is for consistency with our conventions for class constructors documented in https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-subclassing."
rlang,NA,1,278,"`inform()` now prints messages to the standard output by default in interactive sessions. This makes them appear more like normal output in IDEs such as RStudio. In non-interactive sessions, messages are still printed to standard error to make it easy to redirect messages when running R scripts (#852)."
rlang,NA,1,279,Fixed an error in `trace_back()` when the call stack contains a quosured symbol.
rlang,NA,1,280,Backtrace is now displayed in full when an error occurs in non-interactive sessions. Previously the backtraces of parent errors were left out.
rlang,NA,1,281,"New experimental framework for creating bulleted error messages. See `?cnd_message` for the motivation and an overwiew of the tools we have created to support this approach. In particular, `abort()` now takes character vectors to assemble a bullet list. Elements named `x` are prefixed with a red cross, elements named `i` are prefixed with a blue info symbol, and unnamed elements are prefixed with a bullet."
rlang,NA,1,282,Capture of backtrace in the context of rethrowing an error from an exiting handler has been improved. The `tryCatch()` context no longer leaks in the high-level backtrace.
rlang,NA,1,283,"Printing an error no longer recommends calling `last_trace()`, unless called from `last_error()`."
rlang,NA,1,284,"`env_clone()` no longer recreates active bindings and is now just an alias for `env2list(as.list(env))`. Unlike `as.list()` which returns the active binding function on R \< 4.0, the value of active bindings is consistently used in all versions."
rlang,NA,1,285,"The display of rlang errors derived from parent errors has been improved. The simplified backtrace (as printed by `rlang::last_error()`) no longer includes the parent errors. On the other hand, the full backtrace (as printed by `rlang::last_trace()`) now includes the backtraces of the parent errors."
rlang,NA,1,286,"`cnd_signal()` has improved support for rlang errors created with `error_cnd()`. It now records a backtrace if there isn't one already, and saves the error so it can be inspected with `rlang::last_error()`."
rlang,NA,1,287,"rlang errors are no longer formatted and saved through `conditionMessage()`. This makes it easier to use a `conditionMessage()` method in subclasses created with `abort()`, which is useful to delay expensive generation of error messages until display time."
rlang,NA,1,288,`abort()` can now be called without error message. This is useful when `conditionMessage()` is used to generate the message at print-time.
rlang,NA,1,289,Fixed an infinite loop in `eval_tidy()`. It occurred when evaluating a quosure that inherits from the mask itself.
rlang,NA,1,290,`env_bind()`'s performance has been significantly improved by fixing a bug that caused values to be repeatedly looked up by name.
rlang,NA,1,291,`cnd_muffle()` now checks that a restart exists before invoking it. The restart might not exist if the condition is signalled with a different function (such as `stop(warning_cnd)`).
rlang,NA,1,292,`trace_length()` returns the number of frames in a backtrace.
rlang,NA,1,293,Added internal utility `cnd_entrace()` to add a backtrace to a condition.
rlang,NA,1,294,`rlang::last_error()` backtraces are no longer displayed in red.
rlang,NA,1,295,"`x %|% y` now also works when `y` is of same length as `x` (@rcannood, #806)."
rlang,NA,1,296,"Empty named lists are now deparsed more explicitly as `""<named list>""`."
rlang,NA,1,297,Fixed `chr()` bug causing it to return invisibly.
rlang,NA,1,304,"New `pairlist2()` function with splicing support. It preserves missing arguments, which makes it useful for lists of formal parameters for functions."
rlang,NA,1,305,"`is_bool()` is a scalar type predicate that checks whether its input is a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Like `is_string()`, it returns `FALSE` when the input is missing. This is useful for type-checking function arguments (#695)."
rlang,NA,1,306,"`is_string()` gains a `string` argument. `is_string(x, ""foo"")` is a shortcut for `is_character(x) && length(x) == 1 && identical(x, ""foo"")`."
rlang,NA,1,307,Lists of quosures now have pillar methods for display in tibbles.
rlang,NA,1,308,`set_names()` now names unnamed input vectors before applying a function. The following expressions are now equivalent:
rlang,NA,1,309,"You can now pass a character vector as message argument for `abort()`, `warn()`, `inform()`, and `signal()`. The vector is collapsed to a single string with a `""\n""` newline separating each element of the input vector (#744)."
rlang,NA,1,310,`maybe_missing()` gains a `default` argument.
rlang,NA,1,311,"New functions for weak references: `new_weakref()`, `weakref_key()`, `weakref_value()`, and `is_weakref()` (@wch, #787)."
rlang,NA,1,312,"The performance of `exec()` has been improved. It is now on the same order of performance as `do.call()`, though slightly slower."
rlang,NA,1,313,`call2()` now uses the new `pairlist2()` function internally. This considerably improves its performance. This also means it now preserves empty arguments:
rlang,NA,1,314,"`with_handlers()` now installs calling handlers first on the stack, no matter their location in the argument list. This way they always take precedence over exiting handlers, which ensures their side effects (such as logging) take place (#718)."
rlang,NA,1,315,"In rlang backtraces, the `global::` prefix is now only added when the function directly inherits from the global environment. Functions inheriting indirectly no longer have a namespace qualifier (#733)."
rlang,NA,1,316,`options(error = rlang::entrace)` now has better support for errors thrown from C (#779). It also saves structured errors in the `error` field of `rlang::last_error()`.
rlang,NA,1,317,`ns_env()` and `ns_env_name()` (experimental functions) now support functions and environments consisently. They also require an argument from now on.
rlang,NA,1,318,"`is_interactive()` is aware of the `TESTTHAT` environment variable and returns `FALSE` when it is `""true""` (@jennybc, #738)."
rlang,NA,1,319,"`fn_fmls()` and variants no longer coerce their input to a closure. Instead, they throw an error."
rlang,NA,1,320,Fixed an issue in knitr that caused backtraces to print even when `error = TRUE`.
rlang,NA,1,321,"The return object from `as_function()` now inherits from `""function""` (@richierocks, #735)."
rlang,NA,1,323,`modify()` and `prepend()` (two experimental functions marked as in the questioning stage since rlang 0.3.0) are now deprecated. Vector functions are now out of scope for rlang. They might be revived in the vctrs or funs packages.
rlang,NA,1,324,`exiting()` is soft-deprecated because `with_handlers()` treats handlers as exiting by default.
rlang,NA,1,325,The vector constructors like `lgl()` or `new_logical()` are now in the questioning stage. They are likely to be moved to the vctrs package at some point. Same for the missing values shortcuts like `na_lgl`.
rlang,NA,1,326,"`as_logical()`, `as_integer()`, etc have been soft-deprecated in favour of `vctrs::vec_cast()`."
rlang,NA,1,327,"`type_of()`, `switch_type()`, `coerce_type()`, and friends are soft-deprecated."
rlang,NA,1,328,The encoding and locale API was summarily archived. This API didn't bring any value and wasn't used on CRAN.
rlang,NA,1,329,"`lang_type_of()`, `switch_lang()`, and `coerce_lang()` were archived. These functions were not used on CRAN or internally."
rlang,NA,1,330,Subsetting quosures with `[` or `[[` is soft-deprecated.
rlang,NA,1,331,"All functions that were soft-deprecated, deprecated, or defunct in previous releases have been bumped to the next lifecycle stage."
rlang,NA,1,332,Fixed protection issue reported by rchk.
rlang,NA,1,333,The experimental option `rlang__backtrace_on_error` is no longer experimental and has been renamed to `rlang_backtrace_on_error`.
rlang,NA,1,334,"New ""none"" option for `rlang_backtrace_on_error`."
rlang,NA,1,335,Unary operators applied to quosures now give better error messages.
rlang,NA,1,336,"Fixed issue with backtraces of warnings promoted to error, and entraced via `withCallingHandlers()`. The issue didn't affect entracing via top level `options(error = rlang::entrace)` handling."
rlang,NA,1,338,"New `entrace()` condition handler. Add this to your RProfile to enable rlang backtraces for all errors, including warnings promoted to errors:"
rlang,NA,1,339,This handler also works as a calling handler:
rlang,NA,1,340,However it's often more practical to use `with_abort()` in that case:
rlang,NA,1,341,`with_abort()` gains a `classes` argument to promote any kind of condition to an rlang error.
rlang,NA,1,342,New `last_trace()` shortcut to print the backtrace stored in the `last_error()`.
rlang,NA,1,343,Backtrace objects now print in full by default.
rlang,NA,1,344,Calls in backtraces are now numbered according to their position in the call tree. The numbering is non-contiguous for simplified backtraces because of omitted call frames.
rlang,NA,1,345,`catch_cnd()` gains a `classes` argument to specify which classes of condition to catch. It returns `NULL` if the expected condition could not be caught (#696).
rlang,NA,1,349,"Display an object in a concise way, for example to labellise axes in a graphical plot."
rlang,NA,1,350,"Give default names to columns in a data frame. In this case, labelling is the first step before name repair."
rlang,NA,1,355,New `is_interactive()` function. It serves the same purpose as `base::interactive()` but also checks if knitr is in progress and provides an escape hatch. Use `with_interactive()` and `scoped_interactive()` to override the return value of `is_interactive()`. This is useful in unit tests or to manually turn on interactive features in RMarkdown outputs
rlang,NA,1,356,`calling()` now boxes its argument.
rlang,NA,1,357,"New `done()` function to box a value. Done boxes are sentinels to indicate early termination of a loop or computation. For instance, it will be used in the purrr package to allow users to shortcircuit a reduction or accumulation."
rlang,NA,1,358,`new_box()` now accepts additional attributes passed to `structure()`.
rlang,NA,1,359,Fixed a quotation bug with binary operators of zero or one argument such as `` `/`(1) `` (#652). They are now deparsed and printed properly as well.
rlang,NA,1,360,New `call_ns()` function to retrieve the namespace of a call. Returns `NULL` if the call is not namespaced.
rlang,NA,1,361,Top-level S3 objects are now deparsed properly.
rlang,NA,1,362,Empty `{` blocks are now deparsed on the same line.
rlang,NA,1,363,Fixed a deparsing issue with symbols containing non-ASCII characters (#691).
rlang,NA,1,364,"`expr_print()` now handles `[` and `[[` operators correctly, and deparses non-syntactic symbols with backticks."
rlang,NA,1,365,"`call_modify()` now respects ordering of unnamed inputs. Before this fix, it would move all unnamed inputs after named ones."
rlang,NA,1,366,`as_closure()` wrappers now call primitives with positional arguments to avoid edge case issues of argument matching.
rlang,NA,1,367,`as_closure()` wrappers now dispatch properly on methods defined in the global environment (tidyverse/purrr#459).
rlang,NA,1,368,`as_closure()` now supports both base-style (`e1` and `e2`) and purrr-style (`.x` and `.y`) arguments with binary primitives.
rlang,NA,1,369,"`exec()` takes `.fn` as first argument instead of `f`, for consistency with other rlang functions."
rlang,NA,1,370,Fixed infinite loop with quosures created inside a data mask.
rlang,NA,1,371,Base errors set as `parent` of rlang errors are now printed correctly.
rlang,NA,1,373,`quo_text()` now deparses non-syntactic symbols with backticks:
rlang,NA,1,374,"This caused a number of issues in reverse dependencies as `quo_text()` tends to be used for converting symbols to strings. `quo_text()` and `quo_name()` should not be used for this purpose because they are general purpose deparsers. These functions should generally only be used for printing outputs or creating default labels. If you need to convert symbols to strings, please use `as_string()` rather than `quo_text()`."
rlang,NA,1,375,We have extended the documentation of `?quo_text` and `?quo_name` to make these points clearer.
rlang,NA,1,376,"`exprs()` no longer flattens quosures. `exprs(!!!quos(x, y))` is now equivalent to `quos(x, y)`."
rlang,NA,1,377,The sentinel for removing arguments in `call_modify()` has been changed from `NULL` to `zap()`. This breaking change is motivated by the ambiguity of `NULL` with valid argument values.
rlang,NA,1,378,The `%@%` operator now quotes its input and supports S4 objects. This makes it directly equivalent to `@` except that it extracts attributes for non-S4 objects (#207).
rlang,NA,1,379,Taking the `env_parent()` of the empty environment is now an error.
rlang,NA,1,381,"`abort()` now records backtraces automatically in the error object. Errors thrown with `abort()` invite users to call `rlang::last_error()` to see a backtrace and help identifying where and why the error occurred. The backtraces created by rlang (you can create one manually with `trace_back()`) are printed in a simplified form by default that removes implementation details from the backtrace. To see the full backtrace, call `summary(rlang::last_error())`."
rlang,NA,1,382,"`abort()` also gains a `parent` argument. This is meant for situations where you're calling a low level API (to download a file, parse a JSON file, etc) and would like to intercept errors with `base::tryCatch()` or `rlang::with_handlers()` and rethrow them with a high-level message. Call `abort()` with the intercepted error as the `parent` argument. When the user prints `rlang::last_error()`, the backtrace will be shown in two sections corresponding to the high-level and low-level contexts."
rlang,NA,1,383,"In order to get segmented backtraces, the low-level error has to be thrown with `abort()`. When that's not the case, you can call the low-level function within `with_abort()` to automatically promote all errors to rlang errors."
rlang,NA,1,384,The tidy eval changes are mostly for developers of data masking APIs. The main user-facing change is that `.data[[` is now an unquote operator so that `var` in `.data[[var]]` is never masked by data frame columns and always picked from the environment. This makes the pronoun safe for programming in functions.
rlang,NA,1,385,"The `!!!` operator now supports all classed objects like factors. It calls `as.list()` on S3 objects and `as(x, ""list"")` on S4 objects."
rlang,NA,1,386,"`dots_list()` gains several arguments to control how dots are collected. You can control the selection of arguments with the same name with `.homonyms` (keep first, last, all, or abort). You can also elect to preserve empty arguments with `.preserve_empty`."
rlang,NA,1,387,"New `trace_back()` captures a backtrace. Compared to the base R traceback, it contains additional structure about the relationship between frames. It comes with tools for automatically restricting to frames after a certain environment on the stack, and to simplify when printing. These backtraces are now recorded in errors thrown by `abort()` (see below)."
rlang,NA,1,388,`abort()` gains a `parent` argument to specify a parent error. This is meant for situations where a low-level error is expected (e.g. download or parsing failed) and you'd like to throw an error with higher level information. Specifying the low-level error as parent makes it possible to partition the backtraces based on ancestry.
rlang,NA,1,389,Errors thrown with `abort()` now embed a backtrace in the condition object. It is no longer necessary to record a trace with a calling handler for such errors.
rlang,NA,1,390,`with_abort()` runs expressions in a context where all errors are promoted to rlang errors and gain a backtrace.
rlang,NA,1,391,Unhandled errors thrown by `abort()` are now automatically saved and can be retrieved with `rlang::last_error()`. The error prints with a simplified backtrace. Call `summary(last_error())` to see the full backtrace.
rlang,NA,1,392,New experimental option `rlang__backtrace_on_error` to display backtraces alongside error messages. See `?rlang::abort` for supported options.
rlang,NA,1,393,"The new `signal()` function completes the `abort()`, `warn()` and `inform()` family. It creates and signals a bare condition."
rlang,NA,1,394,New `interrupt()` function to simulate an user interrupt from R code.
rlang,NA,1,395,"`cnd_signal()` now dispatches messages, warnings, errors and interrupts to the relevant signalling functions (`message()`, `warning()`, `stop()` and the C function `Rf_onintr()`). This makes it a good choice to resignal a captured condition."
rlang,NA,1,396,"New `cnd_type()` helper to determine the type of a condition (`""condition""`, `""message""`, `""warning""`, `""error""` or `""interrupt""`)."
rlang,NA,1,397,"`abort()`, `warn()` and `inform()` now accepts metadata with `...`. The data are stored in the condition and can be examined by user handlers."
rlang,NA,1,398,Consequently all arguments have been renamed and prefixed with a dot (to limit naming conflicts between arguments and metadata names).
rlang,NA,1,399,`with_handlers()` treats bare functions as exiting handlers (equivalent to handlers supplied to `tryCatch()`). It also supports the formula shortcut for lambda functions (as in purrr).
rlang,NA,1,400,`with_handlers()` now produces a cleaner stack trace.
rlang,NA,1,401,"The input types of `!!!` have been standardised. `!!!` is generally defined on vectors: it takes a vector (typically, a list) and unquotes each element as a separate argument. The standardisation makes `!!!` behave the same in functions taking dots with `list2()` and in quoting functions. `!!!` accepts these types:"
rlang,401,2,402,"Lists, pairlists, and atomic vectors. If they have a class, they are converted with `base::as.list()` to allow S3 dispatch. Following this change, objects like factors can now be spliced without data loss."
rlang,401,2,403,"S4 objects. These are converted with `as(obj, ""list"")` before splicing."
rlang,401,2,404,"Quoted blocks of expressions, i.e. `{ }` calls"
rlang,NA,1,405,`!!!` disallows:
rlang,405,2,406,"Any other objects like functions or environments, but also language objects like formula, symbols, or quosures."
rlang,NA,1,407,Quoting functions used to automatically wrap language objects in lists to make them spliceable. This behaviour is now soft-deprecated and it is no longer valid to write `!!!enquo(x)`. Please unquote scalar objects with `!!` instead.
rlang,NA,1,408,"`dots_list()`, `enexprs()` and `enquos()` gain a `.homonyms` argument to control how to treat arguments with the same name. The default is to keep them. Set it to `""first""` or `""last""` to keep only the first or last occurrences. Set it to `""error""` to raise an informative error about the arguments with duplicated names."
rlang,NA,1,409,"`enexprs()` and `enquos()` now support `.ignore_empty = ""all""` with named arguments as well (#414)."
rlang,NA,1,410,"`dots_list()` gains a `.preserve_empty` argument. When `TRUE`, empty arguments are stored as missing arguments (see `?missing_arg`)."
rlang,NA,1,411,"`dots_list()`, `enexprs()` and `enquos()` gain a `.check_assign` argument. When `TRUE`, a warning is issued when a `<-` call is detected in `...`. No warning is issued if the assignment is wrapped in brackets like `{ a <- 1 }`. The warning lets users know about a possible typo in their code (assigning instead of matching a function parameter) and requires them to be explicit that they really want to assign to a variable by wrapping in parentheses."
rlang,NA,1,412,"`lapply(list(quote(foo)), list2)` no longer evaluates `foo` (#580)."
rlang,NA,1,413,You can now unquote quosured symbols as LHS of `:=`. The symbol is automatically unwrapped from the quosure.
rlang,NA,1,414,"Quosure methods have been defined for common operations like `==`. These methods fail with an informative error message suggesting to unquote the quosure (#478, #tidyverse/dplyr#3476)."
rlang,NA,1,415,"`as_data_pronoun()` now accepts data masks. If the mask has multiple environments, all of these are looked up when subsetting the pronoun. Function objects stored in the mask are bypassed."
rlang,NA,1,416,"It is now possible to unquote strings in function position. This is consistent with how the R parser coerces strings to symbols. These two expressions are now equivalent: `expr(""foo""())` and `expr((!!""foo"")())`."
rlang,NA,1,417,Quosures converted to functions with `as_function()` now support nested quosures.
rlang,NA,1,418,"`expr_deparse()` (used to print quosures at the console) now escapes special characters. For instance, newlines now print as `""\n""` (#484). This ensures that the roundtrip `parse_expr(expr_deparse(x))` is not lossy."
rlang,NA,1,419,`new_data_mask()` now throws an error when `bottom` is not a child of `top` (#551).
rlang,NA,1,420,Formulas are now evaluated in the correct environment within `eval_tidy()`. This fixes issues in dplyr and other tidy-evaluation interfaces.
rlang,NA,1,421,New functions `new_quosures()` and `as_quosures()` to create or coerce to a list of quosures. This is a small S3 class that ensures two invariants on subsetting and concatenation: that each element is a quosure and that the list is always named even if only with a vector of empty strings.
rlang,NA,1,422,"`env()` now treats a single unnamed argument as the parent of the new environment. Consequently, `child_env()` is now superfluous and is now in questioning life cycle."
rlang,NA,1,423,New `current_env()` and `current_fn()` functions to retrieve the current environment or the function being evaluated. They are equivalent to `base::environment()` and `base::sys.function()` called without argument.
rlang,NA,1,424,`env_get()` and `env_get_list()` gain a `default` argument to provide a default value for non-existing bindings.
rlang,NA,1,425,`env_poke()` now returns the old value invisibly rather than the input environment.
rlang,NA,1,426,"The new function `env_name()` returns the name of an environment. It always adds the ""namespace:"" prefix to namespace names. It returns ""global"" instead of "".GlobalEnv"" or ""R_GlobalEnv"", ""empty"" instead of ""R_EmptyEnv"". The companion `env_label()` is like `env_name()` but returns the memory address for anonymous environments."
rlang,NA,1,427,`env_parents()` now returns a named list. The names are taken with `env_name()`.
rlang,NA,1,428,`env_parents()` and `env_tail()` now stop at the global environment by default. This can be changed with the `last` argument. The empty environment is always a stopping condition so you can take the parents or the tail of an environment on the search path without changing the default.
rlang,NA,1,429,New predicates `env_binding_are_active()` and `env_binding_are_lazy()` detect the kind of bindings in an environment.
rlang,NA,1,430,`env_binding_lock()` and `env_binding_unlock()` allows to lock and unlock multiple bindings. The predicate `env_binding_are_locked()` tests if bindings are locked.
rlang,NA,1,431,`env_lock()` and `env_is_locked()` lock an environment or test if an environment is locked.
rlang,NA,1,432,`env_print()` pretty-prints environments. It shows the contents (up to 20 elements) and the properties of the environment.
rlang,NA,1,433,`is_scoped()` has been soft-deprecated and renamed to `is_attached()`. It now supports environments in addition to search names.
rlang,NA,1,434,`env_bind_lazy()` and `env_bind_active()` now support quosures.
rlang,NA,1,435,`env_bind_exprs()` and `env_bind_fns()` are soft-deprecated and renamed to `env_bind_lazy()` and `env_bind_active()` for clarity and consistency.
rlang,NA,1,436,"`env_bind()`, `env_bind_exprs()`, and `env_bind_fns()` now return the list of old binding values (or missing arguments when there is no old value). This makes it easy to restore the original environment state:"
rlang,NA,1,437,"`env_bind()` now supports binding missing arguments and removing bindings with zap sentinels. `env_bind(env, foo = )` binds a missing argument and `env_bind(env, foo = zap())` removes the `foo` binding."
rlang,NA,1,438,The `inherit` argument of `env_get()` and `env_get_list()` has changed position. It now comes after `default`.
rlang,NA,1,439,`scoped_bindings()` and `with_bindings()` can now be called without bindings.
rlang,NA,1,440,`env_clone()` now recreates active bindings correctly.
rlang,NA,1,441,`env_get()` now evaluates promises and active bindings since these are internal objects which should not be exposed at the R level (#554)
rlang,NA,1,442,"`env_print()` calls `get_env()` on its argument, making it easier to see the environment of closures and quosures (#567)."
rlang,NA,1,443,`env_get()` now supports retrieving missing arguments when `inherit` is `FALSE`.
rlang,NA,1,444,"`is_call()` now accepts multiple namespaces. For instance `is_call(x, ""list"", ns = c("""", ""base""))` will match if `x` is `list()` or if it's `base::list()`:"
rlang,NA,1,445,"`call_modify()` has better support for `...` and now treats it like a named argument. `call_modify(call, ... = )` adds `...` to the call and `call_modify(call, ... = NULL)` removes it."
rlang,NA,1,446,`call_modify()` now preserves empty arguments. It is no longer necessary to use `missing_arg()` to add a missing argument to a call. This is possible thanks to the new `.preserve_empty` option of `dots_list()`.
rlang,NA,1,447,`call_modify()` now supports removing unexisting arguments (#393) and passing multiple arguments with the same name (#398). The new `.homonyms` argument controls how to treat these arguments.
rlang,NA,1,448,`call_standardise()` now handles primitive functions like `~` properly (#473).
rlang,NA,1,449,"`call_print_type()` indicates how a call is deparsed and printed at the console by R: prefix, infix, and special form."
rlang,NA,1,450,The `call_` functions such as `call_modify()` now correctly check that their input is the right type (#187).
rlang,NA,1,451,New function `zap()` returns a sentinel that instructs functions like `env_bind()` or `call_modify()` that objects are to be removed.
rlang,NA,1,452,New function `rep_named()` repeats value along a character vector of names.
rlang,NA,1,453,New function `exec()` is a simpler replacement to `invoke()` (#536). `invoke()` has been soft-deprecated.
rlang,NA,1,454,Lambda functions created from formulas with `as_function()` are now classed. Use `is_lambda()` to check a function was created with the formula shorthand.
rlang,NA,1,455,`is_integerish()` now supports large double values (#578).
rlang,NA,1,456,`are_na()` now requires atomic vectors (#558).
rlang,NA,1,457,The operator `%@%` has now a replacement version to update attributes of an object (#207).
rlang,NA,1,458,"`fn_body()` always returns a `{` block, even if the function has a single expression. For instance `fn_body(function(x) do())` returns `quote({ do() })`."
rlang,NA,1,459,`is_string()` now returns `FALSE` for `NA_character_`.
rlang,NA,1,460,The vector predicates have been rewritten in C for performance.
rlang,NA,1,461,The `finite` argument of `is_integerish()` is now `NULL` by default. Missing values are now considered as non-finite for consistency with `base::is.finite()`.
rlang,NA,1,462,`is_bare_integerish()` and `is_scalar_integerish()` gain a `finite` argument for consistency with `is_integerish()`.
rlang,NA,1,463,`flatten_if()` and `squash_if()` now handle primitive functions like `base::is.list()` as predicates.
rlang,NA,1,464,`is_symbol()` now accepts a character vector of names to mach the symbol against.
rlang,NA,1,465,"`parse_exprs()` and `parse_quos()` now support character vectors. Note that the output may be longer than the input as each string may yield multiple expressions (such as `""foo; bar""`)."
rlang,NA,1,466,`parse_quos()` now adds the `quosures` class to its output.
rlang,NA,1,468,rlang has been attached with a `library()` call.
rlang,NA,1,469,The deprecated function has been called from the global environment.
rlang,NA,1,472,"`.data[[foo]]` is now an unquote operator. This guarantees that `foo` is evaluated in the context rather than the data mask and makes it easier to treat `.data[[""bar""]]` the same way as a symbol. For instance, this will help ensuring that `group_by(df, .data[[""name""]])` and `group_by(df, name)` produce the same column name."
rlang,NA,1,473,"Automatic naming of expressions now uses a new deparser (still unexported) instead of `quo_text()`. Following this change, automatic naming is now compatible with all object types (via `pillar::type_sum()` if available), prevents multi-line names, and ensures `name` and `.data[[""name""]]` are given the same default name."
rlang,NA,1,474,Supplying a name with `!!!` calls is soft-deprecated. This name is ignored because only the names of the spliced vector are applied.
rlang,NA,1,475,"Quosure lists returned by `quos()` and `enquos()` now have ""list-of"" behaviour: the types of new elements are checked when adding objects to the list. Consequently, assigning non-quosure objects to quosure lists is now soft-deprecated. Please coerce to a bare list with `as.list()` beforehand."
rlang,NA,1,476,`as_quosure()` now requires an explicit environment for symbols and calls. This should typically be the environment in which the expression was created.
rlang,NA,1,477,`names()` and `length()` methods for data pronouns are deprecated. It is no longer valid to write `names(.data)` or `length(.data)`.
rlang,NA,1,478,Using `as.character()` on quosures is soft-deprecated (#523).
rlang,NA,1,479,Using `get_env()` without supplying an environment is now soft-deprecated. Please use `current_env()` to retrieve the current environment.
rlang,NA,1,480,The frame and stack API is soft-deprecated. Some of the functionality has been replaced by `trace_back()`.
rlang,NA,1,481,The `new_vector_along()` family is soft-deprecated because these functions are longer to type than the equivalent `rep_along()` or `rep_named()` calls without added clarity.
rlang,NA,1,482,Passing environment wrappers like formulas or functions to `env_` functions is now soft-deprecated. This internal genericity was causing confusion (see issue #427). You should now extract the environment separately before calling these functions.
rlang,NA,1,483,"This change concerns `env_depth()`, `env_poke_parent()`, `env_parent<-`, `env_tail()`, `set_env()`, `env_clone()`, `env_inherits()`, `env_bind()`, `scoped_bindings()`, `with_bindings()`, `env_poke()`, `env_has()`, `env_get()`, `env_names()`, `env_bind_exprs()` and `env_bind_fns()`."
rlang,NA,1,484,`cnd_signal()` now always installs a muffling restart for non-critical conditions. Consequently the `.mufflable` argument has been soft-deprecated and no longer has any effect.
rlang,NA,1,486,Calling `UQ()` and `UQS()` with the rlang namespace qualifier is deprecated as of rlang 0.3.0. Just use the unqualified forms instead:
rlang,NA,1,487,"Although soft-deprecated since rlang 0.2.0, `UQ()` and `UQS()` can still be used for now."
rlang,NA,1,488,The `call` argument of `abort()` and condition constructors is now deprecated in favour of storing full backtraces.
rlang,NA,1,489,The `.standardise` argument of `call_modify()` is deprecated. Please use `call_standardise()` beforehand.
rlang,NA,1,490,The `sentinel` argument of `env_tail()` has been deprecated and renamed to `last`.
rlang,NA,1,492,`as_dictionary()` is now defunct.
rlang,NA,1,493,"The experimental function `rst_muffle()` is now defunct. Please use `cnd_muffle()` instead. Unlike its predecessor, `cnd_muffle()` is not generic. It is marked as a calling handler and thus can be passed directly to `with_handlers()` to muffle specific conditions (such as specific subclasses of warnings)."
rlang,NA,1,494,"`cnd_inform()`, `cnd_warn()` and `cnd_abort()` are retired and defunct. The old `cnd_message()`, `cnd_warning()`, `cnd_error()` and `new_cnd()` constructors deprecated in rlang 0.2.0 are now defunct."
rlang,NA,1,495,"Modifying a condition with `cnd_signal()` is defunct. In addition, creating a condition with `cnd_signal()` is soft-deprecated, please use the new function \[signal()\] instead."
rlang,NA,1,496,`inplace()` has been renamed to `calling()` to follow base R terminology more closely.
rlang,NA,1,498,The functions from the restart API are now in the questioning lifecycle stage. It is not clear yet whether we want to recommend restarts as a style of programming in R.
rlang,NA,1,499,"`prepend()` and `modify()` are in the questioning stage, as well as `as_logical()`, `as_character()`, etc. We are still figuring out what vector tools belong in rlang."
rlang,NA,1,500,"`flatten()`, `squash()` and their atomic variants are now in the questioning lifecycle stage. They have slightly different semantics than the flattening functions in purrr and we are currently rethinking our approach to flattening with the new typing facilities of the vctrs package."
rlang,NA,1,503,Functions with tidy dots support now allow splicing atomic vectors.
rlang,NA,1,504,Quosures no longer capture the current `srcref`.
rlang,NA,1,505,Formulas are now evaluated in the correct environment by `eval_tidy()`. This fixes issues in dplyr and other tidy-evaluation interfaces.
rlang,NA,1,507,The `!!` operator now has the precedence of unary `+` and `-` which allows a much more natural syntax: `!!a > b` only unquotes `a` rather than the whole `a > b` expression.
rlang,NA,1,508,`enquo()` works in magrittr pipes: `mtcars %>% select(!!enquo(var))`.
rlang,NA,1,509,`enquos()` is a variant of `quos()` that has a more natural interface for capturing multiple arguments and `...`.
rlang,NA,1,512,"The backend for `quos()`, `exprs()`, `list2()`, `dots_list()`, etc is now written in C. This greatly improve the performance of dots capture, especially with the splicing operator `!!!` which now scales much better (you'll see a 1000x performance gain in some cases). The unquoting algorithm has also been improved which makes `enexpr()` and `enquo()` more efficient as well."
rlang,NA,1,513,"The tidy eval `!!` operator now binds tightly. You no longer have to wrap it in parentheses, i.e. `!!x > y` will only unquote `x`."
rlang,NA,1,514,Technically the `!!` operator has the same precedence as unary `-` and `+`. This means that `!!a:b` and `!!a + b` are equivalent to `(!!a):b` and `(!!a) + b`. On the other hand `!!a^b` and `!!a$b` are equivalent to`!!(a^b)` and `!!(a$b)`.
rlang,NA,1,515,"The print method for quosures has been greatly improved. Quosures no longer appear as formulas but as expressions prefixed with `^`; quosures are colourised according to their environment; unquoted objects are displayed between angular brackets instead of code (i.e. an unquoted integer vector is shown as `<int: 1, 2>` rather than `1:2`); unquoted S3 objects are displayed using `pillar::type_sum()` if available."
rlang,NA,1,516,"New `enquos()` function to capture arguments. It treats `...` the same way as `quos()` but can also capture named arguments just like `enquo()`, i.e. one level up. By comparison `quos(arg)` only captures the name `arg` rather than the expression supplied to the `arg` argument."
rlang,NA,1,517,"In addition, `enexprs()` is like `enquos()` but like `exprs()` it returns bare expressions. And `ensyms()` expects strings or symbols."
rlang,NA,1,518,It is now possible to use `enquo()` within a magrittr pipe:
rlang,NA,1,519,"Technically, this is because `enquo()` now also captures arguments in parents of the current environment rather than just in the current environment. The flip side of this increased flexibility is that if you made a typo in the name of the variable you want to capture, and if an object of that name exists anywhere in the parent contexts, you will capture that object rather than getting an error."
rlang,NA,1,520,`quo_expr()` has been renamed to `quo_squash()` in order to better reflect that it is a lossy operation that flattens all nested quosures.
rlang,NA,1,521,`!!!` now accepts any kind of objects for consistency. Scalar types are treated as vectors of length 1. Previously only symbolic objects like symbols and calls were treated as such.
rlang,NA,1,522,`ensym()` is a new variant of `enexpr()` that expects a symbol or a string and always returns a symbol. If a complex expression is supplied it fails with an error.
rlang,NA,1,523,`exprs()` and `quos()` gain a `.unquote_names` arguments to switch off interpretation of `:=` as a name operator. This should be useful for programming on the language targetting APIs such as data.table.
rlang,NA,1,524,`exprs()` gains a `.named` option to auto-label its arguments (#267).
rlang,NA,1,525,"Functions taking dots by value rather than by expression (e.g. regular functions, not quoting functions) have a more restricted set of unquoting operations. They only support `:=` and `!!!`, and only at top-level. I.e. `dots_list(!!! x)` is valid but not `dots_list(nested_call(!!! x))` (#217)."
rlang,NA,1,526,Functions taking dots with `list2()` or `dots_list()` now support splicing of `NULL` values. `!!! NULL` is equivalent to `!!! list()` (#242).
rlang,NA,1,527,"Capture operators now support evaluated arguments. Capturing a forced or evaluated argument is exactly the same as unquoting that argument: the actual object (even if a vector) is inlined in the expression. Capturing a forced argument occurs when you use `enquo()`, `enexpr()`, etc too late. It also happens when your quoting function is supplied to `lapply()` or when you try to quote the first argument of an S3 method (which is necessarily evaluated in order to detect which class to dispatch to). (#295, #300)."
rlang,NA,1,528,"Parentheses around `!!` are automatically removed. This makes the generated expression call cleaner: `(!! sym(""name""))(arg)`. Note that removing the parentheses will never affect the actual precedence within the expression as the parentheses are only useful when parsing code as text. The parentheses will also be added by R when printing code if needed (#296)."
rlang,NA,1,529,Quasiquotation now supports `!!` and `!!!` as functional forms:
rlang,NA,1,530,This is consistent with the way native R operators parses to function calls. These new functional forms are to be preferred to `UQ()` and `UQS()`. We are now questioning the latter and might deprecate them in a future release.
rlang,NA,1,531,The quasiquotation parser now gives meaningful errors in corner cases to help you figure out what is wrong.
rlang,NA,1,532,"New getters and setters for quosures: `quo_get_expr()`, `quo_get_env()`, `quo_set_expr()`, and `quo_set_env()`. Compared to `get_expr()` etc, these accessors only work on quosures and are slightly more efficient."
rlang,NA,1,533,`quo_is_symbol()` and `quo_is_call()` now take the same set of arguments as `is_symbol()` and `is_call()`.
rlang,NA,1,534,`enquo()` and `enexpr()` now deal with default values correctly (#201).
rlang,NA,1,535,Splicing a list no longer mutates it (#280).
rlang,NA,1,536,The new functions `cnd_warn()` and `cnd_inform()` transform conditions to warnings or messages before signalling them.
rlang,NA,1,537,`cnd_signal()` now returns invisibly.
rlang,NA,1,538,`cnd_signal()` and `cnd_abort()` now accept character vectors to create typed conditions with several S3 subclasses.
rlang,NA,1,539,`is_condition()` is now properly exported.
rlang,NA,1,540,Condition signallers such as `cnd_signal()` and `abort()` now accept a call depth as `call` arguments. This allows plucking a call from further up the call stack (#30).
rlang,NA,1,541,New helper `catch_cnd()`. This is a small wrapper around `tryCatch()` that captures and returns any signalled condition. It returns `NULL` if none was signalled.
rlang,NA,1,542,"`cnd_abort()` now adds the correct S3 classes for error conditions. This fixes error catching, for instance by `testthat::expect_error()`."
rlang,NA,1,543,`env_get_list()` retrieves muliple bindings from an environment into a named list.
rlang,NA,1,544,`with_bindings()` and `scoped_bindings()` establish temporary bindings in an environment.
rlang,NA,1,545,`is_namespace()` is a snake case wrapper around `isNamespace()`.
rlang,NA,1,546,"New functions `inherits_any()`, `inherits_all()`, and `inherits_only()`. They allow testing for inheritance from multiple classes. The `_any` variant is equivalent to `base::inherits()` but is more explicit about its behaviour. `inherits_all()` checks that all classes are present in order and `inherits_only()` checks that the class vectors are identical."
rlang,NA,1,547,New `fn_fmls<-` and `fn_fmls_names<-` setters.
rlang,NA,1,548,"New function experimental function `chr_unserialise_unicode()` for turning characters serialised to unicode point form (e.g. `<U+xxxx>`) to UTF-8. In addition, `as_utf8_character()` now translates those as well. (@krlmlr)"
rlang,NA,1,549,`expr_label()` now supports quoted function definition calls (#275).
rlang,NA,1,550,`call_modify()` and `call_standardise()` gain an argument to specify an environment. The call definition is looked up in that environment when the call to modify or standardise is not wrapped in a quosure.
rlang,NA,1,551,`is_symbol()` gains a `name` argument to check that that the symbol name matches a string (#287).
rlang,NA,1,552,"New `rlang_box` class. Its purpose is similar to the `AsIs` class from `base::I()`, i.e. it protects a value temporarily. However it does so by wrapping the value in a scalar list. Use `new_box()` to create a boxed value, `is_box()` to test for a boxed value, and `unbox()` to unbox it. `new_box()` and `is_box()` accept optional subclass."
rlang,NA,1,553,"The vector constructors such as `new_integer()`, `new_double_along()` etc gain a `names` argument. In the case of the `_along` family it defaults to the names of the input vector."
rlang,NA,1,554,"When nested quosures are evaluated with `eval_tidy()`, the `.env` pronoun now correctly refers to the current quosure under evaluation (#174). Previously it would always refer to the environment of the outermost quosure."
rlang,NA,1,555,`as_pairlist()` (part of the experimental API) now supports `NULL` and objects of type pairlist (#397).
rlang,NA,1,556,"Fixed a performance bug in `set_names()` that caused a full copy of the vector names (@jimhester, #366)."
rlang,NA,1,558,"The particle ""lang"" has been renamed to ""call"":"
rlang,558,2,559,`lang()` has been renamed to `call2()`.
rlang,558,2,560,`new_language()` has ben renamed to `new_call()`.
rlang,558,2,561,`is_lang()` has been renamed to `is_call()`. We haven't replaced the `is_unary_lang()` and `is_binary_lang()` because they are redundant with the `n` argument of `is_call()`.
rlang,558,2,562,"All call accessors such as `lang_fn()`, `lang_name()`, `lang_args()` etc are soft-deprecated and renamed with `call_` prefix."
rlang,NA,1,563,"In rlang 0.1 calls were called ""language"" objects in order to follow the R type nomenclature as returned by `base::typeof()`. We wanted to avoid adding to the confusion between S modes and R types. With hindsight we find it is better to use more meaningful type names."
rlang,NA,1,564,"We now use the term ""data mask"" instead of ""overscope"". We think data mask is a more natural name in the context of R. We say that that objects from user data mask objects in the current environment. This makes reference to object masking in the search path which is due to the same mechanism (in technical terms, lexical scoping with hierarchically nested environments)."
rlang,NA,1,565,"Following this new terminology, the new functions `as_data_mask()` and `new_data_mask()` replace `as_overscope()` and `new_overscope()`. `as_data_mask()` has also a more consistent interface. These functions are only meant for developers of tidy evaluation interfaces."
rlang,NA,1,566,We no longer require a data mask (previously called overscope) to be cleaned up after evaluation. `overscope_clean()` is thus soft-deprecated without replacement.
rlang,NA,1,567,"`!!` now binds tightly in order to match intuitive parsing of tidy eval code, e.g. `!! x > y` is now equivalent to `(!! x) > y`. A corollary of this new syntax is that you now have to be explicit when you want to unquote the whole expression on the right of `!!`. For instance you have to explicitly write `!! (x > y)` to unquote `x > y` rather than just `x`."
rlang,NA,1,568,"`UQ()`, `UQS()` and `:=` now issue an error when called directly. The previous definitions caused surprising results when the operators were invoked in wrong places (i.e. not in quasiquoted arguments)."
rlang,NA,1,569,"The prefix form `` `!!`() `` is now an alias to `!!` rather than `UQE()`. This makes it more in line with regular R syntax where operators are parsed as regular calls, e.g. `a + b` is parsed as `` `+`(a, b) `` and both forms are completely equivalent. Also the prefix form `` `!!!`() `` is now equivalent to `!!!`."
rlang,NA,1,570,`UQE()` is now deprecated in order to simplify the syntax of quasiquotation. Please use `!! get_expr(x)` instead.
rlang,NA,1,571,`expr_interp()` now returns a formula instead of a quosure when supplied a formula.
rlang,NA,1,572,`is_quosureish()` and `as_quosureish()` are deprecated. These functions assumed that quosures are formulas but that is only an implementation detail.
rlang,NA,1,573,"`new_cnd()` is now `cnd()` for consistency with other constructors. Also, `cnd_error()`, `cnd_warning()` and `cnd_message()` are now `error_cnd()`, `warning_cnd()` and `message_cnd()` to follow our naming scheme according to which the type of output is a suffix rather than a prefix."
rlang,NA,1,574,`is_node()` now returns `TRUE` for calls as well and `is_pairlist()` does not return `TRUE` for `NULL` objects. Use `is_node_list()` to determine whether an object either of type `pairlist` or `NULL`. Note that all these functions are still experimental.
rlang,NA,1,575,`set_names()` no longer automatically splices lists of character vectors as we are moving away from automatic splicing semantics.
rlang,NA,1,576,Calling the functional forms of unquote operators with the rlang namespace qualifier is soft-deprecated. `UQ()` and `UQS()` are not function calls so it does not make sense to namespace them. Supporting namespace qualifiers complicates the implementation of unquotation and is misleading as to the nature of unquoting (which are syntactic operators at quotation-time rather than function calls at evaluation-time).
rlang,NA,1,577,"We are now questioning `UQ()` and `UQS()` as functional forms of `!!`. If `!!` and `!!!` were native R operators, they would parse to the functional calls `` `!!`() `` and `` `!!!`() ``. This is now the preferred way to unquote with a function call rather than with the operators. We haven't decided yet whether we will deprecate `UQ()` and `UQS()` in the future. In any case we recommend using the new functional forms."
rlang,NA,1,578,`parse_quosure()` and `parse_quosures()` are soft-deprecated in favour of `parse_quo()` and `parse_quos()`. These new names are consistent with the rule that abbreviated suffixes indicate the return type of a function. In addition the new functions require their callers to explicitly supply an environment for the quosures.
rlang,NA,1,579,Using `f_rhs()` and `f_env()` on quosures is soft-deprecated. The fact that quosures are formulas is an implementation detail that might change in the future. Please use `quo_get_expr()` and `quo_get_env()` instead.
rlang,NA,1,580,`quo_expr()` is soft-deprecated in favour of `quo_squash()`. `quo_expr()` was a misnomer because it implied that it was a mere expression acccessor for quosures whereas it was really a lossy operation that squashed all nested quosures.
rlang,NA,1,581,"With the renaming of the `lang` particle to `call`, all these functions are soft-deprecated: `lang()`, `is_lang()`, `lang_fn()`, `lang_name()`, `lang_args()`."
rlang,NA,1,582,"In addition, `lang_head()` and `lang_tail()` are soft-deprecated without replacement because these are low level accessors that are rarely needed."
rlang,NA,1,583,`as_overscope()` is soft-deprecated in favour of `as_data_mask()`.
rlang,NA,1,584,"The node setters were renamed from `mut_node_` prefix to `node_poke_`. This change follows a new naming convention in rlang where mutation is referred to as ""poking""."
rlang,NA,1,585,`splice()` is now in questioning stage as it is not needed given the `!!!` operator works in functions taking dots with `dots_list()`.
rlang,NA,1,586,"`lgl_len()`, `int_len()` etc have been soft-deprecated and renamed with `new_` prefix, e.g. `new_logical()` and `new_integer()`. This is for consistency with other non-variadic object constructors."
rlang,NA,1,587,`ll()` is now an alias to `list2()`. This is consistent with the new `call2()` constructor for calls. `list2()` and `call2()` are versions of `list()` and `call()` that support splicing of lists with `!!!`. `ll()` remains around as a shorthand for users who like its conciseness.
rlang,NA,1,588,"Automatic splicing of lists in vector constructors (e.g. `lgl()`, `chr()`, etc) is now soft-deprecated. Please be explicit with the splicing operator `!!!`."
rlang,NA,1,589,This is a maintenance release in anticipation of a forthcoming change to R's C API (use `MARK_NOT_MUTABLE()` instead of `SET_NAMED()`).
rlang,NA,1,590,New function `is_reference()` to check whether two objects are one and the same.
rlang,NA,1,591,`eval_tidy()` no longer maps over lists but returns them literally. This behaviour is an overlook from past refactorings and was never documented.
rlang,NA,1,594,Bare formulas are now evaluated in the correct environment in tidyeval functions.
rlang,NA,1,595,"`enquo()` now works properly within compiled functions. Before this release, constants optimised by the bytecode compiler couldn't be enquoted."
rlang,NA,1,596,"The `new_environment()` constructor creates a child of the empty environment and takes an optional named list of data to populate it. Compared to `env()` and `child_env()`, it is meant to create environments as data structures rather than as part of a scope hierarchy."
rlang,NA,1,597,The `new_call()` constructor creates calls out of a callable object (a function or an expression) and a pairlist of arguments. It is useful to avoid costly internal coercions between lists and pairlists of arguments.
rlang,NA,1,598,`env_child()`'s first argument is now `.parent` instead of `parent`.
rlang,NA,1,599,`mut_` setters like `mut_attrs()` and environment helpers like `env_bind()` and `env_unbind()` now return their (modified) input invisibly. This follows the tidyverse convention that functions called primarily for their side effects should return their input invisibly.
rlang,NA,1,600,"`is_pairlist()` now returns `TRUE` for `NULL`. We added `is_node()` to test for actual pairlist nodes. In other words, `is_pairlist()` tests for the data structure while `is_node()` tests for the type."
rlang,NA,1,601,"`env()` and `env_child()` can now get arguments whose names start with `.`. Prior to this fix, these arguments were partial-matching on `env_bind()`'s `.env` argument."
rlang,NA,1,602,The internal `replace_na()` symbol was renamed to avoid a collision with an exported function in tidyverse. This solves an issue occurring in old versions of R prior to 3.3.2 (#133).
rstudioapi,NA,1,1,`documentPath()` now marks the encoding of file paths as UTF-8. (#257)
rstudioapi,NA,1,2,"`getSourceEditorContext()` gains the `id` argument, to be used to request the editor context for a document with an already-known ID. (#251)"
rstudioapi,NA,1,3,"Added `documentOpen()`, for opening a document in RStudio and optionally navigating the cursor to a particular point in the file. The method is synchronous and returns the document ID upon completion."
rstudioapi,NA,1,4,Fixed an issue where `rstudioapi::askForSecret()` would erroneously fall back to using `rstudioapi::askForPassword()` during Knit.
rstudioapi,NA,1,5,"Added `registerCommandCallback`, `registerCommandStreamCallback`, and `unregisterCommandCallback`, used to execute a callback after an IDE command is executed."
rstudioapi,NA,1,6,Fixed an issue where `rstudioapi::insertText()` would fail. (#208)
rstudioapi,NA,1,7,Fixed an issue where remote `rstudioapi` calls would erroneously use a previous response in some cases.
rstudioapi,NA,1,8,Allow `navigateToFile` to accept an empty file. This file will default to the file currently in view in the active column.
rstudioapi,NA,1,9,"Added `registerChunkExecCallback` and `unregisterChunkExecCallback`, used to execute a callback after a chunk is ran."
rstudioapi,NA,1,10,`rstudioapi::launcherResourceLimit()` now properly delegates the type and memory arguments. (#164)
rstudioapi,NA,1,11,"`rstudioapi` gains the function `highlightUi()`, used to highlight UI elements in newer versions of RStudio."
rstudioapi,NA,1,12,Paths returned from `selectFile()` are now properly marked with UTF-8 encoding.
rstudioapi,NA,1,13,"It is now possible for `rstudioapi` to communicate with a parent RStudio session, for R sessions launched as RStudio jobs. Use `rstudioapi::isAvailable(child_ok = TRUE)` to assert that it's okay to check that `rstudioapi` is available and is running within an RStudio job."
rstudioapi,NA,1,14,"Added `bugReport()`, a helper function for reporting RStudio bugs on the GitHub issue tracker with an issue template pre-populated with some helpful diagnostic information."
rstudioapi,NA,1,15,"Added `userIdentity` and `systemUsername`, used to retrieve information about the current user."
rstudioapi,NA,1,16,Added the parameters `echo` and `focus` to `sendToConsole()`.
rstudioapi,NA,1,17,"Added functions for displaying jobs in RStudio's Jobs pane: `jobAdd()`, `jobRemove()`, etc."
rstudioapi,NA,1,18,"Added `translateLocalUrl()`, for translating localhost URLs to externally addressable ones on RStudio Server."
rstudioapi,NA,1,19,"Added functions for installing + using build tools: `buildToolsCheck()`, `buildToolsInstall()`, `buildToolsExec()`"
rstudioapi,NA,1,20,"Added functions for installing + using themes: `addTheme()`, `applyTheme()`, `convertTheme()`, `getThemes()`, `getThemeInfo()`."
rstudioapi,NA,1,21,"Added `previewSql()`, for previewing output from executing a SQL query."
rstudioapi,NA,1,22,"Added `askForSecret()`, for prompting the user to enter a password or otherwise privileged information."
rstudioapi,NA,1,23,Fixed an issue where `getActiveProject()` failed for non-ASCII paths. (#86)
rstudioapi,NA,1,24,"Added methods for prompting the user for file paths: `selectFile()`, `selectDirectory()`."
rstudioapi,NA,1,25,`askForPassword()` gains a default prompt (#41)
rstudioapi,NA,1,26,Add `createProjectTemplate()` function
rstudioapi,NA,1,27,Add `setPersistentValue()` / `getPersistentValue()` functions
rstudioapi,NA,1,28,"Add methods for interacting with Terminal tab: `terminalActivate()`, `terminalClear()`, `terminalCreate()`, `terminalList()`, `terminalBuffer()`, `terminalContext()`, `terminalVisible()`, `terminalBusy()`, `terminalRunning()`, `terminalKill()`, `terminalSend()`, `terminalExecute()`, and `terminalExitCode()`."
rstudioapi,NA,1,29,Add sendToConsole function
rstudioapi,NA,1,30,Add APIs for setting cursor position in document
rstudioapi,NA,1,31,Add askForPassword function
rstudioapi,NA,1,32,Add getActiveProject function
rstudioapi,NA,1,33,"Add API methods for interacting with a document open in RStudio: 'insertText()', 'modifyRange()' and 'getActiveDocumentContext()'."
rstudioapi,NA,1,34,Add stub and documentation for sourceMarker function
rstudioapi,NA,1,35,Compatibility with calling conventions for RStudio v0.99
rstudioapi,NA,1,36,"Stubs and documentation for versionInfo, previewRd, and viewer functions"
rstudioapi,NA,1,37,Initial release to CRAN
rvest,NA,1,1,Re-document to fix HTML issues in `.Rd`.
rvest,NA,1,2,Fixes for CRAN
rvest,NA,1,3,"`html_table()` converts empty tables to empty tibbles (@epiben, #327)."
rvest,NA,1,4,"`html_table()` correctly handles tables with cells that contain blank values for `rowspan` and/or `colspan`, so that e.g. `<td rowspan="""">` is parsed as `<td rowspan=1>` (@epiben, #323)."
rvest,NA,1,5,Fix broken example
rvest,NA,1,6,"New `html_text2()` provides a more natural rendering of HTML nodes into text, converting `<br>` into ""`\n`{=tex}"", and removing non-significant whitespace (#175). By default, it also converts `&nbsp;` into regular spaces, which you can suppress with `preserve_nbsp = TRUE` (#284)."
rvest,NA,1,7,"`html_table()` has been re-written from scratch to more closely mimic the algorithm that browsers use for parsing tables. This should mean that there are far fewer tables for which it fails to produce some output (#63, #204, #215). The `fill` argument has been deprecated since it is no longer needed. `html_table()` now returns a tibble rather than a data frame to be compatible with the rest of the tidyverse (#199). Its performance has been considerably improved (#237). It also gains a `na.strings` argument to control what values are converted to `NA` (#107), and a `convert` argument to control whether to run the conversion (#311)."
rvest,NA,1,8,"New `html_form_submit()` allows you to submit a form directly, without needing to create a session (#300)."
rvest,NA,1,9,rvest is now licensed as MIT (#287).
rvest,NA,1,11,"rvest now imports xml2 rather than depending on it. This is cleaner because it avoids attaching all the xml2 functions that you're less likely to use. To reduce the change of breakages, rvest re-exports xml2 functions `read_html()` and `url_absolute()`, but your code may now need an explicit `library(xml2)`."
rvest,NA,1,12,"`html_form()` now returns an object with class `rvest_form` (instead of form). Fields within a form now have class `rvest_field`, instead of a variety of classes that were lacking the `rvest_` prefix. All functions for working with forms have a common `html_form_` prefix: `set_values()` became `html_form_set()`. `submit_form()` was renamed to `session_submit()` because it returns a session."
rvest,NA,1,13,"`html_node()` and `html_nodes()` have been superseded in favor of `html_element()` and `html_elements()` since they (almost) always return elements, not nodes (#298)."
rvest,NA,1,14,`html_session()` is now `session()` and returns an object of class `rvest_session` (instead of `session`). All functions that work with session objects now have a common `session_` prefix.
rvest,NA,1,15,"Long deprecated `html()`, `html_tag()`, `xml()` functions have been removed."
rvest,NA,1,16,`minimal_html()` (which doesn't appear to be used by any other package) has had its arguments flipped to make it more intuitive.
rvest,NA,1,17,`guess_encoding()` has been renamed to `html_encoding_guess()` to avoid a clash with `stringr::guess_encoding()` (#209). `repair_encoding()` has been deprecated because it doesn't appear to work.
rvest,NA,1,18,`pluck()` is no longer exported to avoid a clash with `purrr::pluck()`; if you need it use `purrr::map_chr()` and friends instead (#209).
rvest,NA,1,19,"`xml_tag()`, `xml_node()`, and `xml_nodes()` have been formally deprecated in favor of their `html_` equivalents."
rvest,NA,1,20,"The ""harvesting the web"" vignette has been rewritten to focus more on basics rvest, eliminating the screenshots to keep the installed package as svelte as possible. It's also been renamed to `vignette(""rvest"")` since it's the vignette that you should read first."
rvest,NA,1,21,"The SelectorGadget vignette is now a web-only article, <https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/selectorgadget.html>, so we can be more generous with screenshots since they're no longer bundled with every install of the package. Together with the rewrite of the other vignette, this means that rvest is now \~90 Kb instead of \~1.1 Mb."
rvest,NA,1,22,All uses of IMDB have been eliminated since the site explicitly prohibits scraping (#195).
rvest,NA,1,23,`session_submit()` errors if `form` doesn't have a `url` (#288).
rvest,NA,1,24,New `session_forward()` function to complement `session_back()`. It now allows you to pick the submission button by position (#156). The `...` argument is deprecated; please use `config` instead.
rvest,NA,1,25,"`html_form_set()` can now accept character vectors allowing you to select multiple checkboxes in a set or select multiple values from a multi-`<select>` (#127, with help from @juba). It also uses dynamic dots so that you can use `!!!` if you have a list of values (#189)."
rvest,NA,1,26,Remove failing example
rvest,NA,1,27,Use web archive to fix broken example.
rvest,NA,1,28,Remove unneeded `read_xml.response()` method (#242).
rvest,NA,1,29,Fix `R CMD check` failure
rvest,NA,1,30,"`submit_request()` now checks for empty form-field-types to select the correct submit fields (@rentrop, #159)"
rvest,NA,1,31,Fixes to `follow_link()` and `back()` to correctly manage session history.
rvest,NA,1,32,"If you're using xml2 1.0.0, `html_node()` will now return a ""missing node""."
rvest,NA,1,33,Parse rowspans and colspans effectively by filling using repetition from left to right (for colspan) and top to bottom (rowspan) (#111)
rvest,NA,1,34,Updated a few examples and demos where the website structure has changed.
rvest,NA,1,35,Made compatible with both xml2 0.1.2 and 1.0.0.
rvest,NA,1,36,Fix invalid link for SSA example.
rvest,NA,1,37,Parse `<options>` that don't have value attribute (#85).
rvest,NA,1,38,"Remove all remaining uses of `html()` in favor of `read_html()` (@jimhester, #113)."
rvest,NA,1,39,"rvest has been rewritten to take advantage of the new xml2 package. xml2 provides a fresh binding to libxml2, avoiding many of the work-arounds previously needed for the XML package. Now rvest depends on the xml2 package, so all the xml functions are available, and rvest adds a thin wrapper for html."
rvest,NA,1,40,"A number of functions have change names. The old versions still work, but are deprecated and will be removed in rvest 0.4.0."
rvest,40,2,41,`html_tag()` -\> `html_name()`
rvest,40,2,42,`html()` -\> `read_html()`
rvest,NA,1,43,"`html_node()` now throws an error if there are no matches, and a warning if there's more than one match. I think this should make it more likely to fail clearly when the structure of the page changes."
rvest,NA,1,44,`xml_structure()` has been moved to xml2. New `html_structure()` (also in xml2) highlights id and class attributes (#78).
rvest,NA,1,45,`submit_form()` now works with forms that use GET (#66).
rvest,NA,1,46,"`submit_request()` (and hence `submit_form()`) is now case-insensitive, and so will find `<input type=SUBMIT>` as well as`<input type=""submit"">`."
rvest,NA,1,47,"`submit_request()` (and hence `submit_form()`) recognizes forms with `<input type=""image"">` as a valid form submission button."
rvest,NA,1,48,`html()` and `xml()` pass `...` on to `httr::GET()` so you can more finely control the request (#48).
rvest,NA,1,49,"Add xml support: parse with `xml()`, then work with using `xml_node()`, `xml_attr()`, `xml_attrs()`, `xml_text()` and `xml_tag()` (#24)."
rvest,NA,1,50,`xml_structure()`: new function that displays the structure (i.e. tag and attribute names) of a xml/html object (#10).
rvest,NA,1,51,"`follow_link()` now accepts css and xpath selectors. (#38, #41, #42)"
rvest,NA,1,52,"`html()` does a better job of dealing with encodings (passing the problem on to `XML::parseHTML()`) instead of trying to do it itself (#25, #50)."
rvest,NA,1,53,`html_attr()` returns default value when input is NULL (#49)
rvest,NA,1,54,Add missing `html_node()` method for session.
rvest,NA,1,55,`html_nodes()` now returns an empty list if no elements are found (#31).
rvest,NA,1,56,`submit_form()` converts relative paths to absolute URLs (#52). It also deals better with 0-length inputs (#29).
stringr,NA,1,1,stringr functions now consistently implement the tidyverse recycling rules (#372). Overall this is a fairly minor change as stringi was already very close to the tidyverse rules. There are only two major changes:
stringr,1,2,2,"Only vectors of length 1 are recycled: previously, `str_detect(letters, c(""x"", ""y""))` worked, but it now errors."
stringr,1,2,3,"`str_c()` ignores `NULLs`, rather than treating them as length 0 vectors."
stringr,NA,1,4,"Additionally, many more non-vectorised arguments now throw errors, rather than warnings, if supplied a vector."
stringr,NA,1,5,"`str_split_fixed()` now pads with `NA` rather than `"" ""` (#195)."
stringr,NA,1,6,`regex()` and friends now generate class names with `stringr_` prefix (#384).
stringr,NA,1,7,`str_view()` will use ANSI colouring if available (#370). This works in more places than HTML widgets and requires fewer dependencies. `str_view()` also no longer requires a pattern so you can use it to display strings with special characters. It now highlights whitespace characters apart from space since otherwise they are often confusing. It's also now vectorised over both `string` and `pattern` (#407).
stringr,NA,1,8,"New `vignette(""from-base"")` by @sastoudt provides a comprehensive comparison between base R functions and their stringr equivalents. It's designed to help you move to stringr if you're already familiar with base R string functions (#266)."

stringr,NA,1,19,"Many typos in `sentences` have been fixed (@romatik, #299)"
stringr,NA,1,20,`str_flatten()` gains a `last` argument that optionally override the final separator (#377). It gains a `na.rm` argument to remove missing values (since it's a summary function) (#439).
stringr,NA,1,21,"`str_pad()` gains `use_width` argument to control whether to use the total code point width or the number of code points as ""width"" of a string (#190)."
stringr,NA,1,22,`str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` can use standard tidyverse formula shorthand for `replacement` function (#331).
stringr,NA,1,23,`str_starts()` and `str_ends()` now correctly respect regex operator precedence (@carlganz).

stringr,NA,1,32,"`str_trunc()` is once again vectorised correctly (#203, @austin3dickey)."
stringr,NA,1,33,"`str_view()` handles `NA` values more gracefully (#217). I've also tweaked the sizing policy so hopefully it should work better in notebooks, while preserving the existing behaviour in knit documents (#232)."
stringr,NA,1,34,"During package build, you may see `Error : object ‘ignore.case’ is not exported by 'namespace:stringr'`. This is because the long deprecated `str_join()`, `ignore.case()` and `perl()` have now been removed."

stringr,NA,1,36,`str_flatten()` is a wrapper around `stri_flatten()` and clearly conveys flattening a character vector into a single string (#186).
stringr,NA,1,37,"`str_remove()` and `str_remove_all()` functions. These wrap `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` to remove patterns from strings. (@Shians, #178)"

stringr,NA,1,44,"In `str_replace()`, `replacement` can now be a function that is called once for each match and whose return value is used to replace the match."
stringr,NA,1,45,New `str_which()` mimics `grep()` (#129).

stringr,NA,1,47,`str_order()` and `str_sort()` gain explicit `numeric` argument for sorting mixed numbers and strings.
stringr,NA,1,48,`str_replace_all()` now throws an error if `replacement` is not a character vector. If `replacement` is `NA_character_` it replaces the complete string with replaces with `NA` (#124).
stringr,NA,1,49,"All functions that take a locale (e.g. `str_to_lower()` and `str_sort()`) default to ""en"" (English) to ensure that the default is consistent across platforms."
stringr,NA,1,50,"Add sample datasets: `fruit`, `words` and `sentences`."
stringr,NA,1,51,"`fixed()`, `regex()`, and `coll()` now throw an error if you use them with anything other than a plain string (#60). I've clarified that the replacement for `perl()` is `regex()` not `regexp()` (#61). `boundary()` has improved defaults when splitting on non-word boundaries (#58, @lmullen)."
stringr,NA,1,52,`str_detect()` now can detect boundaries (by checking for a `str_count()` \> 0) (#120). `str_subset()` works similarly.
stringr,NA,1,53,`str_extract()` and `str_extract_all()` now work with `boundary()`. This is particularly useful if you want to extract logical constructs like words or sentences. `str_extract_all()` respects the `simplify` argument when used with `fixed()` matches.

stringr,NA,1,59,"stringr is now powered by [stringi](https://github.com/Rexamine/stringi) instead of base R regular expressions. This improves unicode and support, and makes most operations considerably faster. If you find stringr inadequate for your string processing needs, I highly recommend looking at stringi in more detail."
stringr,NA,1,60,"stringr gains a vignette, currently a straight forward update of the article that appeared in the R Journal."
stringr,NA,1,61,"`str_c()` now returns a zero length vector if any of its inputs are zero length vectors. This is consistent with all other functions, and standard R recycling rules. Similarly, using `str_c(""x"", NA)` now yields `NA`. If you want `""xNA""`, use `str_replace_na()` on the inputs."
stringr,NA,1,62,`str_replace_all()` gains a convenient syntax for applying multiple pairs of pattern and replacement to the same vector:
stringr,NA,1,63,"`str_match()` now returns NA if an optional group doesn't match (previously it returned """"). This is more consistent with `str_extract()` and other match failures."
stringr,NA,1,64,"New `str_subset()` keeps values that match a pattern. It's a convenient wrapper for `x[str_detect(x)]` (#21, @jiho)."
stringr,NA,1,65,New `str_order()` and `str_sort()` allow you to sort and order strings in a specified locale.
stringr,NA,1,66,New `str_conv()` to convert strings from specified encoding to UTF-8.
stringr,NA,1,67,"New modifier `boundary()` allows you to count, locate and split by character, word, line and sentence boundaries."
stringr,NA,1,68,"The documentation got a lot of love, and very similar functions (e.g. first and all variants) are now documented together. This should hopefully make it easier to locate the function you need."
stringr,NA,1,69,"`ignore.case(x)` has been deprecated in favour of `fixed|regex|coll(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`, `perl(x)` has been deprecated in favour of `regex(x)`."

stringr,NA,1,74,Export `str_join`
stringr,NA,1,75,new modifier `perl` that switches to Perl regular expressions
stringr,NA,1,76,`str_match` now uses new base function `regmatches` to extract matches - this should hopefully be faster than my previous pure R algorithm

stringr,NA,1,83,fix small bug in internal `recyclable` function
stringr,NA,1,84,"all functions now vectorised with respect to string, pattern (and where appropriate) replacement parameters"
stringr,NA,1,85,"fixed() function now tells stringr functions to use fixed matching, rather than escaping the regular expression. Should improve performance for large vectors."
stringr,NA,1,86,new ignore.case() modifier tells stringr functions to ignore case of pattern.
stringr,NA,1,87,str_replace renamed to str_replace_all and new str_replace function added. This makes str_replace consistent with all functions.
stringr,NA,1,88,new str_sub\<- function (analogous to substring\<-) for substring replacement
stringr,NA,1,89,str_sub now understands negative positions as a position from the end of the string. -1 replaces Inf as indicator for string end.
stringr,NA,1,90,"str_pad side argument can be left, right, or both (instead of center)"
stringr,NA,1,91,str_trim gains side argument to better match str_pad
stringr,NA,1,92,stringr now has a namespace and imports plyr (rather than requiring it)
stringr,NA,1,93,fixed() now also escapes \|

tibble,346,2,349,"`glimpse()` now (invisibly) returns its argument (hadley/dplyr#1570). It is now a generic, the default method dispatches to `str()` (hadley/dplyr#1325). The default width is obtained from the `tibble.width` option (#35, #56)."
tibble,346,2,350,"`as_data_frame()` is now an S3 generic with methods for lists (the old `as_data_frame()`), data frames (trivial), matrices (with efficient C++ implementation) (hadley/dplyr#876), and `NULL` (returns a 0-row 0-column data frame) (#17, @jennybc)."

tibble,352,2,353,"`frame_data()` properly constructs rectangular tables (hadley/dplyr#1377, @kevinushey)."
tibble,NA,1,354,Minor modifications
tibble,354,2,355,"Uses `setOldClass(c(""tbl_df"", ""tbl"", ""data.frame""))` to help with S4 (hadley/dplyr#969)."
tibble,354,2,356,`tbl_df()` automatically generates column names (hadley/dplyr#1606).
tibble,354,2,357,"`tbl_df`s gain `$` and `[[` methods that are \~5x faster than the defaults, never do partial matching (hadley/dplyr#1504), and throw an error if the variable does not exist. `[[.tbl_df()` falls back to regular subsetting when used with anything other than a single string (#29). `base::getElement()` now works with tibbles (#9)."
tibble,354,2,358,"`all_equal()` allows to compare data frames ignoring row and column order, and optionally ignoring minor differences in type (e.g. int vs. double) (hadley/dplyr#821). Used by `all.equal()` for tibbles. (This package contains a pure R implementation of `all_equal()`, the `dplyr` code has identical behavior but is written in C++ and thus faster.)"
tibble,354,2,359,"The internals of `data_frame()` and `as_data_frame()` have been aligned, so `as_data_frame()` will now automatically recycle length-1 vectors. Both functions give more informative error messages if you are attempting to create an invalid data frame. You can no longer create a data frame with duplicated names (hadley/dplyr#820). Both functions now check that you don't have any `POSIXlt` columns, and tell you to use `POSIXct` if you do (hadley/dplyr#813). `data_frame(NULL)` raises error ""must be a 1d atomic vector or list""."
tibble,354,2,360,`trunc_mat()` and `print.tbl_df()` are considerably faster if you have very wide data frames. They will now also only list the first 100 additional variables not already on screen - control this with the new `n_extra` parameter to `print()` (hadley/dplyr#1161). The type of list columns is printed correctly (hadley/dplyr#1379). The `width` argument is used also for 0-row or 0-column data frames (#18).

tidyr,NA,1,2,"`uncount()` is now generic so implementations can be provided for objects other than data frames (@mgirlich, #1358)."
tidyr,NA,1,3,"`uncount()` gained the `...` argument. It comes between the required and the optional arguments (@mgirlich, #1358)."
tidyr,NA,1,4,`pivot_longer()` gained a new `cols_vary` argument for controlling the ordering of the output rows relative to their original row number (#1312).
tidyr,NA,1,5,"`pivot_longer()` is now more memory efficient due to the usage of `vctrs::vec_interleave()` (#1310, @mgirlich)."
tidyr,NA,1,6,rlang \>=1.0.2 and vctrs \>=0.4.1 are now required (#1344).
tidyr,NA,1,7,Removed dependency on ellipsis in favor of equivalent functions in rlang (#1314).
tidyr,NA,1,8,"`fill()` now works correctly when there is a column named `.direction` in `data` (#1319, @tjmahr)."
tidyr,NA,1,9,Added documentation to the `replace` argument of `replace_na()` to mention that it is always cast to the type of `data` (#1317).
tidyr,NA,1,10,Improved the error message returned by `pivot_wider()` when a column selected by `names_from` or `values_from` is also selected by `id_cols` (#1318).
tidyr,NA,1,11,Hot patch release to resolve R CMD check failures.
tidyr,NA,1,12,"`complete()` and `expand()` no longer allow you to complete or expand on a grouping column. This was never well-defined since completion/expansion on a grouped data frame happens ""within"" each group and otherwise has the potential to produce erroneous results (#1299)."
tidyr,NA,1,13,"`replace_na()` no longer allows the type of `data` to change when the replacement is applied. `replace` will now always be cast to the type of `data` before the replacement is made. For example, this means that using a replacement value of `1.5` on an integer column is no longer allowed. Similarly, replacing missing values in a list-column must now be done with `list(""foo"")` rather than just `""foo""`."
tidyr,NA,1,14,`pivot_wider()` gains new `names_expand` and `id_expand` arguments for turning implicit missing factor levels and variable combinations into explicit ones. This is similar to the `drop` argument from `spread()` (#770).
tidyr,NA,1,15,`pivot_wider()` gains a new `names_vary` argument for controlling the ordering when combining `names_from` values with `values_from` column names (#839).
tidyr,NA,1,16,"`pivot_wider()` gains a new `unused_fn` argument for controlling how to summarize unused columns that aren't involved in the pivoting process (#990, thanks to @mgirlich for an initial implementation)."
tidyr,NA,1,17,"`pivot_longer()`'s `names_transform` and `values_transform` arguments now accept a single function which will be applied to all of the columns (#1284, thanks to @smingerson for an initial implementation)."

tidyr,NA,1,19,`unnest()` and `unchop()`'s `ptype` argument now accepts a single empty ptype which will be applied to all `cols` (#1284).
tidyr,NA,1,20,`unpack()` now silently skips over any non-data frame columns specified by `cols`. This matches the existing behavior of `unchop()` and `unnest()` (#1153).
tidyr,NA,1,21,`unnest_wider()` and `unnest_longer()` can now unnest multiple columns at once (#740).
tidyr,NA,1,22,"`unnest_longer()`'s `indices_to` and `values_to` arguments now accept a glue specification, which is useful when unnesting multiple columns."
tidyr,NA,1,23,"For `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`, if a `ptype` is supplied, but that column can't be simplified, the result will be a list-of column where each element has type `ptype` (#998)."
tidyr,NA,1,24,"`unnest_wider()` gains a new `strict` argument which controls whether or not strict vctrs typing rules should be applied. It defaults to `FALSE` for backwards compatibility, and because it is often more useful to be lax when unnesting JSON, which doesn't always map one-to-one with R's types (#1125)."
tidyr,NA,1,25,"`hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `simplify` argument now accepts a named list of `TRUE` or `FALSE` to control simplification on a per column basis (#995)."

tidyr,NA,1,27,"`hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `ptype` argument now accepts a single empty ptype which will be applied to all components (#1284)."
tidyr,NA,1,28,`complete()` gains a new `explicit` argument for limiting `fill` to only implicit missing values. This is useful if you don't want to fill in pre-existing missing values (#1270).
tidyr,NA,1,29,"`complete()` gains a grouped data frame method. This generates a more correct completed data frame when groups are involved (#396, #966)."
tidyr,NA,1,30,"`drop_na()`, `replace_na()`, and `fill()` have been updated to utilize vctrs. This means that you can use these functions on a wider variety of column types, including lubridate's Period types (#1094), data frame columns, and the [rcrd](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/new_rcrd.html) type from vctrs."
tidyr,NA,1,31,`replace_na()` no longer replaces empty atomic elements in list-columns (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is replaced in a list-column is `NULL` (#1168).
tidyr,NA,1,32,`drop_na()` no longer drops empty atomic elements from list-columns (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is dropped in a list-column is `NULL` (#1228).
tidyr,NA,1,33,@mgirlich is now a tidyr author in recognition of his significant and sustained contributions.
tidyr,NA,1,34,All lazyeval variants of tidyr verbs have been soft-deprecated. Expect them to move to the defunct stage in the next minor release of tidyr (#1294).

tidyr,NA,1,40,`pivot_wider()` now works correctly when `values_fill` is a data frame.
tidyr,NA,1,41,`pivot_wider()` no longer accidentally retains `values_from` when pivoting a zero row data frame (#1249).
tidyr,NA,1,42,`pivot_wider()` now correctly handles the case where an id column name collides with a value from `names_from` (#1107).
tidyr,NA,1,43,"`pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` now both check that the spec columns `.name` and `.value` are character vectors. Additionally, the `.name` column must be unique (#1107)."
tidyr,NA,1,44,"`pivot_wider()`'s `names_from` and `values_from` arguments are now required if their default values of `name` and `value` don't correspond to columns in `data`. Additionally, they must identify at least 1 column in `data` (#1240)."
tidyr,NA,1,45,`pivot_wider()`'s `values_fn` argument now correctly allows anonymous functions (#1114).
tidyr,NA,1,46,"`pivot_wider_spec()` now works correctly with a 0-row data frame and a `spec` that doesn't identify any rows (#1250, #1252)."
tidyr,NA,1,47,`pivot_longer()`'s `names_ptypes` argument is now applied after `names_transform` for consistency with the rectangling functions (i.e. `hoist()`) (#1233).
tidyr,NA,1,48,`check_pivot_spec()` is a new developer facing function for validating a pivot `spec` argument. This is only useful if you are extending `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()` with new S3 methods (#1087).
tidyr,NA,1,49,"The `nest()` generic now avoids computing on `.data`, making it more compatible with lazy tibbles (#1134)."
tidyr,NA,1,50,The `.names_sep` argument of the data.frame method for `nest()` is now actually used (#1174).
tidyr,NA,1,51,`unnest()`'s `ptype` argument now works as expected (#1158).
tidyr,NA,1,52,`unpack()` no longer drops empty columns specified through `cols` (#1191).
tidyr,NA,1,53,`unpack()` now works correctly with data frame columns containing 1 row but 0 columns (#1189).
tidyr,NA,1,54,`chop()` now works correctly with data frames with 0 rows (#1206).
tidyr,NA,1,55,`chop()`'s `cols` argument is no longer optional. This matches the behavior of `cols` seen elsewhere in tidyr (#1205).
tidyr,NA,1,56,`unchop()` now respects `ptype` when unnesting a non-list column (#1211).
tidyr,NA,1,57,`hoist()` no longer accidentally removes elements that have duplicated names (#1259).
tidyr,NA,1,58,"The grouped data frame methods for `complete()` and `expand()` now move the group columns to the front of the result (in addition to the columns you completed on or expanded, which were already moved to the front). This should make more intuitive sense, as you are completing or expanding ""within"" each group, so the group columns should be the first thing you see (#1289)."
tidyr,NA,1,59,`complete()` now applies `fill` even when no columns to complete are specified (#1272).
tidyr,NA,1,60,"`expand()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` now correctly retain `NA` values of factors (#1275)."
tidyr,NA,1,61,"`expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now silently apply name repair to automatically named inputs. This avoids a number of issues resulting from duplicate truncated names (#1116, #1221, #1092, #1037, #992)."
tidyr,NA,1,62,"`expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now allow columns from unnamed data frames to be used in expressions after that data frame was specified, like `expand_grid(tibble(x = 1), y = x)`. This is more consistent with how `tibble()` behaves."
tidyr,NA,1,63,"`expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now work correctly with data frames containing 0 columns but \>0 rows (#1189)."
tidyr,NA,1,64,"`expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now return a 1 row data frame when no inputs are supplied, which is more consistent with `prod() == 1L` and the idea that computations involving the number of combinations computed from an empty set should return 1 (#1258)."
tidyr,NA,1,65,`drop_na()` no longer drops missing values from all columns when a tidyselect expression that results in 0 columns being selected is used (#1227).
tidyr,NA,1,66,`fill()` now treats `NaN` like any other missing value (#982).
tidyr,NA,1,67,"`expand_grid()` is now about twice as fast and `pivot_wider()` is a bit faster (@mgirlich, #1130)."

tidyr,NA,1,69,"`unnest()` is now much faster (@mgirlich, @DavisVaughan, #1127)."
tidyr,NA,1,70,"`unnest()` no longer allows unnesting a list-col containing a mix of vector and data frame elements. Previously, this only worked by accident, and is considered an off-label usage of `unnest()` that has now become an error."

tidyr,NA,1,84,`pivot_longer()` no longer creates a `.copy` variable in the presence of duplicate column names. This makes it more consistent with the handling of non-unique specs.
tidyr,NA,1,85,"`pivot_longer()` automatically disambiguates non-unique ouputs, which can occur when the input variables include some additional component that you don't care about and want to discard (#792, #793)."
tidyr,NA,1,86,"`pivot_wider()` gains a `names_sort` argument which allows you to sort column names in order. The default, `FALSE`, orders columms by their first appearance (#839). In a future version, I'll consider changing the default to `TRUE`."

tidyr,NA,1,88,"`pivot_wider()` arguments `values_fn` and `values_fill` can now be single values; you now only need to use a named list if you want to use different values for different value columns (#739, #746). They also get improved errors if they're not of the expected type."
tidyr,NA,1,89,"`hoist()` now automatically names pluckers that are a single string (#837). It error if you use duplicated column names (@mgirlich, #834), and now uses `rlang::list2()` behind the scenes (which means that you can now use `!!!` and `:=`) (#801)."
tidyr,NA,1,90,"`unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, and `hoist()` do a better job simplifying list-cols. They no longer add unneeded `unspecified()` when the result is still a list (#806), and work when the list contains non-vectors (#810, #848)."

tidyr,NA,1,111,"`nest()` now preserves grouping, which has implications for downstream calls to group-aware functions, such as `dplyr::mutate()` and `filter()`."
tidyr,NA,1,112,The first argument of `nest()` has changed from `data` to `.data`.
tidyr,NA,1,113,`unnest()` uses the [emerging tidyverse standard](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/01/tibble-2.0.1/#name-repair) to disambiguate unique names. Use `names_repair = tidyr_legacy` to request the previous approach.
tidyr,NA,1,114,"`unnest_()`/`nest_()` and the lazyeval methods for `unnest()`/`nest()` are now defunct. They have been deprecated for some time, and, since the interface has changed, package authors will need to update to avoid deprecation warnings. I think one clean break should be less work for everyone."
tidyr,NA,1,115,"All other lazyeval functions have been formally deprecated, and will be made defunct in the next major release. (See [lifecycle vignette](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html) for details on deprecation stages)."
tidyr,NA,1,116,"`crossing()` and `nesting()` now return 0-row outputs if any input is a length-0 vector. If you want to preserve the previous behaviour which silently dropped these inputs, you should convert empty vectors to `NULL`. (More discussion on this general pattern at https://github.com/tidyverse/principles/issues/24)"
tidyr,NA,1,128,"New `keep_empty` parameter ensures that every row in the input gets at least one row in the output, inserting missing values as needed (#358)."
tidyr,NA,1,129,Provides `names_sep` argument to control how inner and outer column names are combined.
tidyr,NA,1,130,"Uses standard tidyverse name-repair rules, so by default you will get an error if the output would contain multiple columns with the same name. You can override by using `name_repair` (#514)."

tidyr,NA,1,136,"New `expand_grid()`, a tidy version of `expand.grid()`, is lower-level than the existing `expand()` and `crossing()` functions, as it takes individual vectors, and does not sort or uniquify them."
tidyr,NA,1,137,"`crossing()`, `nesting()`, and `expand()` have been rewritten to use the vctrs package. This should not affect much existing code, but considerably simplies the implementation and ensures that these functions work consistently across all generalised vectors (#557). As part of this alignment, these functions now only drop `NULL` inputs, not any 0-length vector."
tidyr,NA,1,138,"`full_seq()` now also works when gaps between observations are shorter than the given `period`, but are within the tolerance given by `tol`. Previously, gaps between consecutive observations had to be in the range \[`period`, `period + tol`\]; gaps can now be in the range \[`period - tol`, `period + tol`\] (@ha0ye, #657)."
tidyr,NA,1,139,"tidyr now re-exports `tibble()`, `as_tibble()`, and `tribble()`, as well as the tidyselect helpers (`starts_with()`, `ends_width()`, ...). This makes generating documentation, reprexes, and tests easier, and makes tidyr easier to use without also attaching dplyr."
tidyr,NA,1,140,All functions that take `...` have been instrumented with functions from the [ellipsis](https://github.com/r-lib/ellipsis/) package to warn if you've supplied arguments that are ignored (typically because you've misspelled an argument name) (#573).

tidyr,NA,1,154,Minor updates to ensure compatibility with dependencies.
tidyr,NA,1,155,"`unnest()` weakens test of ""atomicity"" to restore previous behaviour when unnesting factors and dates (#407)."
tidyr,NA,1,156,"There are no deliberate breaking changes in this release. However, a number of packages are failing with errors related to numbers of elements in columns, and row names. It is possible that these are accidental API changes or new bugs. If you see such an error in your package, I would sincerely appreciate a minimal reprex."
tidyr,NA,1,157,"`separate()` now correctly uses -1 to refer to the far right position, instead of -2. If you depended on this behaviour, you'll need to switch on `packageVersion(""tidyr"") > ""0.7.2""`"
tidyr,NA,1,158,Increased test coverage from 84% to 99%.
tidyr,NA,1,159,`uncount()` performs the inverse operation of `dplyr::count()` (#279)
tidyr,NA,1,160,`complete(data)` now returns `data` rather than throwing an error (#390). `complete()` with zero-length completions returns original input (#331).

tidyr,NA,1,165,"`drop_na()` no longer drops columns (@jennybryan, #245), and works with list-cols (#280). Equivalent of `NA` in a list column is any empty (length 0) data structure."
tidyr,NA,1,166,"`nest()` is now faster, especially when a long data frame is collapsed into a nested data frame with few rows."
tidyr,NA,1,167,`nest()` on a zero-row data frame works as expected (#320).
tidyr,NA,1,168,`replace_na()` no longer complains if you try and replace missing values in variables not present in the data (#356).
tidyr,NA,1,169,"`replace_na()` now also works with vectors (#342, @flying-sheep), and can replace `NULL` in list-columns. It throws a better error message if you attempt to replace with something other than length 1."
tidyr,NA,1,170,"`separate()` no longer checks that `...` is empty, allowing methods to make use of it. This check was added in tidyr 0.4.0 (2016-02-02) to deprecate previous behaviour where `...` was passed to `strsplit()`."

tidyr,NA,1,183,"The SE variants `gather_()`, `spread_()` and `nest_()` now treat non-syntactic names in the same way as pre tidy eval versions of tidyr (#361)."
tidyr,NA,1,184,Fix tidyr bug revealed by R-devel.
tidyr,NA,1,189,"If you see error messages about objects or functions not found, it is likely because the selecting functions are now stricter in their arguments An example of selecting function is `gather()` and its `...` argument. This change makes the code more robust by disallowing ambiguous scoping. Consider the following code:"
tidyr,NA,1,190,"Does it select the first three columns (using the `x` defined in the global environment), or does it select the first two columns (using the column named `x`)?"
tidyr,NA,1,191,"To solve this ambiguity, we now make a strict distinction between data and context expressions. A data expression is either a bare name or an expression like `x:y` or `c(x, y)`. In a data expression, you can only refer to columns from the data frame. Everything else is a context expression in which you can only refer to objects that you have defined with `<-`."
tidyr,NA,1,192,In practice this means that you can no longer refer to contextual objects like this:
tidyr,NA,1,193,"You now have to be explicit about where to find objects. To do so, you can use the quasiquotation operator `!!` which will evaluate its argument early and inline the result:"
tidyr,NA,1,194,An alternative is to turn your data expression into a context expression by using `seq()` or `seq_len()` instead of `:`. See the section on tidyselect for more information about these semantics.
tidyr,NA,1,195,"Following the switch to tidy evaluation, you might see warnings about the ""variable context not set"". This is most likely caused by supplyng helpers like `everything()` to underscored versions of tidyr verbs. Helpers should be always be evaluated lazily. To fix this, just quote the helper with a formula: `drop_na(df, ~everything())`."
tidyr,NA,1,196,The selecting functions are now stricter when you supply integer positions. If you see an error along the lines of
tidyr,NA,1,197,please round the positions before supplying them to tidyr. Double vectors are fine as long as they are rounded.
tidyr,NA,1,202,"The arguments for selecting a single variable now support all features from `dplyr::pull()`. You can supply a name or a position, including negative positions."
tidyr,NA,1,203,"Multiple variables are now selected a bit differently. We now make a strict distinction between data and context expressions. A data expression is either a bare name of an expression like `x:y` or `c(x, y)`. In a data expression, you can only refer to columns from the data frame. Everything else is a context expression in which you can only refer to objects that you have defined with `<-`."
tidyr,NA,1,204,You can still refer to contextual objects in a data expression by being explicit. One way of being explicit is to unquote a variable from the environment with the tidy eval operator `!!`:
tidyr,NA,1,205,"On the other hand, select helpers like `start_with()` are context expressions. It is therefore easy to refer to objects and they will never be ambiguous with data columns:"
tidyr,NA,1,206,While these special rules is in contrast to most dplyr and tidyr verbs (where both the data and the context are in scope) they make sense for selecting functions and should provide more robust and helpful semantics.
