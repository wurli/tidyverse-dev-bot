rlang,1,62,65,FALSE,The `.data` object exported by rlang now fails when subsetted instead of returning `NULL`. This new error helps you detect when `.data` is used in the wrong context. We've noticed several packages failing after this change because they were using `.data` outside of a data-masking context. For instance the `by` argument of `dplyr::join()` is not data-masked. Previously `dplyr::join(by = .data$foo)` would silently be interpreted as `dplyr::join(by = NULL)`. This is now an error. Another issue is using `.data` inside `ggplot2::labs(...)`.

We've added the function `is_call_simple()` to make it easier to work safely with `call_name()`. The invariant is that `call_name()` always returns a string when `is_call_simple()` returns `TRUE`.

rlang,1,516,538,FALSE,"`lgl_len()`, `int_len()` etc have been soft-deprecated and renamed with `new_` prefix, e.g. `new_logical()` and `new_integer()`. This is for consistency with other non-variadic object constructors.",NA
rlang,1,517,539,FALSE,`ll()` is now an alias to `list2()`. This is consistent with the new `call2()` constructor for calls. `list2()` and `call2()` are versions of `list()` and `call()` that support splicing of lists with `!!!`. `ll()` remains around as a shorthand for users who like its conciseness.,NA
rlang,1,518,540,FALSE,"Automatic splicing of lists in vector constructors (e.g. `lgl()`, `chr()`, etc) is now soft-deprecated. Please be explicit with the splicing operator `!!!`.",NA
rlang,1,519,541,FALSE,This is a maintenance release in anticipation of a forthcoming change to R's C API (use `MARK_NOT_MUTABLE()` instead of `SET_NAMED()`).,NA
rlang,1,520,542,FALSE,New function `is_reference()` to check whether two objects are one and the same.,NA
rlang,1,521,543,FALSE,`eval_tidy()` no longer maps over lists but returns them literally. This behaviour is an overlook from past refactorings and was never,NA
rlang,1,522,544,FALSE,Bare formulas are now evaluated in the correct environment in tidyeval functions.,NA
rlang,1,523,545,FALSE,"`enquo()` now works properly within compiled functions. Before this release, constants optimised by the bytecode compiler couldn't be enquoted.",NA
rlang,1,524,546,FALSE,"The `new_environment()` constructor creates a child of the empty environment and takes an optional named list of data to populate it. Compared to `env()` and `child_env()`, it is meant to create environments as data structures rather than as part of a scope hierarchy.",NA
rlang,1,525,547,FALSE,The `new_call()` constructor creates calls out of a callable object (a function or an expression) and a pairlist of arguments. It is useful to avoid costly internal coercions between lists and pairlists of arguments.,NA
rlang,1,526,548,FALSE,`env_child()`'s first argument is now `.parent` instead of `parent`.,NA
rlang,1,527,549,FALSE,`mut_` setters like `mut_attrs()` and environment helpers like `env_bind()` and `env_unbind()` now return their (modified) input invisibly. This follows the tidyverse convention that functions called primarily for their side effects should return their input invisibly.,NA
rlang,1,528,550,FALSE,"`is_pairlist()` now returns `TRUE` for `NULL`. We added `is_node()` to test for actual pairlist nodes. In other words, `is_pairlist()` tests for the data structure while `is_node()` tests for the type.",NA
rlang,1,529,551,FALSE,"`env()` and `env_child()` can now get arguments whose names start with `.`. Prior to this fix, these arguments were partial-matching on `env_bind()`'s `.env` argument.",NA
rlang,1,530,552,FALSE,The internal `replace_na()` symbol was renamed to avoid a collision with an exported function in tidyverse. This solves an issue occurring in old versions of R prior to 3.3.2 (#133).,NA
